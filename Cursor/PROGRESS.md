# Consultify — Test Coverage Progress

## How to Update
- After each milestone, run `npm run test:coverage`.
- Capture global metrics and top uncovered modules (backend + frontend).
- Record changes and any approved exceptions.

## Current Baseline
- Global (from last known run): ~28% statements (see `coverage_output.txt`).
