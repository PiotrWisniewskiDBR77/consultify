Piotr Wisniewski, PhD 471 Axis 2: Digital products Digital products represent a pivotal category in the digital transformation landscape, encapsulating goods and services that are stored, delivered and used in an electronic format. These products, ranging from software and apps to digital media, offer businesses a significant competitive edge due to their scalability and potential for rapid global distribution. As digital products bypass traditional physical limitations, they open avenues for companies to access wider markets more efficiently and at a lower cost. This inherent scalability and reach make digital products not just a transformative force but a critical element in redefining market boundaries and establishing new revenue streams in the hyper-competitive digital economy. Even within digital products, we can discern various levels of maturity and sophistication. Basic products like e-books, audiobooks, or movies can be effortlessly downloaded or streamed from online platforms such as Amazon and Audible. For instance, a customer might purchase an e-book on a website and download it to their e-reader device. Moving towards more complex solutions, intermediate products that amalgamate multiple formats \u2013 such as multimedia, e-books and audio or video files \u2013 are accessible on a variety of devices or platforms, including streaming platforms like Netflix. A website might offer a multimedia package that includes e-books and audio or video files that can be utilized across different devices. Advanced electronic products enhance user experience with additional features such as personalization, user interaction, or artificial intelligence. For example, a mobile app may allow users to customize settings and interact with other users, adding a layer of engagement and functionality. Products can offer interactivity, such as many video games, virtual reality, educational apps or design tools that enable users to actively collaborate on or modify the product. Many video games allow users to interact with a virtual environment and make decisions that affect the game`s progress.

An Digital Pathfinder 472 AI-based data analysis system uses machine learning algorithms to process and analyse large datasets. In this area, we analyse the capability of products to transition to, or be developed in, digital formats, which notably enhances their accessibility and distribution efficiency. Community engagement in product development is evaluated to determine how well products foster the user loyalty and engagement that are crucial for long-term success. The connection to the ICT industry is also scrutinized to understand its impact on a company`s innovative capacity and competitive edge. Personalization of products is explored to ascertain how effectively products can be tailored to meet the unique demands of individual customers, an increasingly important factor in customer satisfaction and retention. Finally, the scalability of products is examined, focusing on the ability to expand production or services to meet escalating demand without sacrificing quality or performance. This comprehensive approach ensures a thorough understanding of a product`s digital maturity and market adaptability. For digital products, a five-tier model has been proposed to assess digital maturity. Due to the wide variety of assessment areas, it was not feasible to assign universally descriptive names to the various stages of digital development. Thus, the progression in digital product development is described simply in terms of advancement from a basic level to an expert level. This progression encapsulates a gradual enhancement in the sophistication and capabilities of the products, reflecting their increasing integration and utilization of digital technologies.

Piotr Wisniewski, PhD Axis 3: Digital business models The axis of digital business models represents a critical component in the framework of digital transformation, as it underpins how companies generate value and interact with the modern digital economy. This axis explores the evolution from traditional business models to innovative digital formats that leverage technology to create, deliver and capture value in unique and dynamic ways. Digital business models enable organizations to respond more effectively to consumer demands and market changes, often leading to increased efficiency and opening up new revenue streams. As we examine this axis, we will be looking at the shift towards models that prioritize agility, customer engagement and continual adaptation to technological advancements. This transformation is not just about adopting new technologies but also about rethinking the organization`s approach to business, and making strategic use of digital tools to enhance competitiveness and sustainable advantages in the digital era. The assessment covers five key areas: the use of e- commerce models, platform solutions, As-a-Service models, asset sharing and data monetization. Each category is crucial for understanding how businesses adapt to and thrive in the digital economy, focusing on scalability, customer engagement and the strategic use of digital tools to develop a competitive edge. 483 --- END OF FILE: 2.

Piotr Wisniewski, PhD 525 Axis 6: Cybersecurity In the digital age, cybersecurity has transcended its past role as a mere safeguard to become a fundamental pillar of operational integrity and trust. As organizations increasingly digitalize their operations, the importance of robust cybersecurity measures has never been more critical. Accordingly, this sixth axis of digital transformation explores how deeply an organization has ingrained security practices into its digital and operational fabric. The relentless evolution of cyber threats means that a proactive stance on cybersecurity is not just advisable; it is imperative for protecting sensitive customer data, ensuring privacy and maintaining the trust that is so crucial to sustaining reputation and financial viability. This axis evaluates an organization`s cybersecurity maturity across five distinct but interconnected areas: strategy and risk management, protection of networks and systems, data security, education and training, and emergency planning. Each area is assessed on a graduated scale that corresponds to the depth and sophistication of cybersecurity measures in place. From the basics of securing network perimeters to the complexities of managing a comprehensive emergency response, this axis provides a structured framework to gauge how prepared an organization is to defend against and respond to cyber incidents with the potential to disrupt operations and compromise data --- END OF FILE: 5.

In conclusion, cybersecurity is often underappreciated until a crisis unfolds. Much like safety measures in traditional industries, where the value of a Safety Officer is often only recognized following a serious incident, the critical importance of robust cybersecurity measures tends to be realized in hindsight. As enterprises expand their digital footprints, the necessity for both technical and non-technical measures to safeguard information, systems, and software becomes increasingly imperative . This aspect of digital transformation is not merely a precaution ; it is an essential component of maintaining trust and operational integrity in the digital age. Neglecting this could lead to severe consequences, making it essential for businesses to prioritize and continuously enhance their cybersecurity strategies.

Os AI opis.pdf --- AXIS 7: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE READINESS & INTEGRATION (Wprowadzenie do ca\u0142ej osi \u2013 styl zgodny z pozosta\u0142ymi osiami DRD) Artificial Intelligence has become one of the most transformative forces shaping modern organizations. While earlier axes examine processes, data, culture or products, this axis focuses on the organization\u2019s ability to adopt, scale and operationalize AI in a structured, safe and value-creating manner. AI is no longer an experimental technology reserved for innovators. It increasingly defines competitive advantage, productivity, decision-making quality and the speed at which organizations can respond to change. Companies that understand how to integrate AI into their architecture, processes, people and governance structures will build stronger adaptability and long-term resilience. Axis 7 evaluates maturity across five areas that collectively determine the organization\u2019s readiness for AI: 7A \u2013 Data Exposure & AI Foundations Evaluates how accessible, structured and prepared the organization\u2019s data is for use by AI models. 7B \u2013 AI-Augmented Processes Describes how deeply AI supports or automates decision-making inside operational and administrative workflows. 7C \u2013 AI in Products & Services Assesses whether AI enhances offerings or becomes a core component of new digital products. 7D \u2013 AI Governance, Safety & Ethics Measures the organization\u2019s capability to manage risks, compliance and responsible AI deployment. 7E \u2013 AI Empowerment of Employees Examines whether employees possess the skills, tools and routines to work effectively with AI in daily operations. The maturity scale, similarly to other axes, ranges from Level 1 (initial) to Level 5 (advanced) and allows organizations to identify precisely where they stand and what steps must be taken to progress to the next stage. AREA 7A \u2014 Data Exposure & AI Foundations Wprowadzenie (dlaczego to wa\u017cne) Artificial Intelligence is only as powerful as the data it can access. Organizations with fragmented, inconsistent or inaccessible data struggle to achieve meaningful AI outcomes. Conversely, companies that maintain structured, integrated and governed data environments progress quickly toward automation, advanced analytics and generative AI adoption. This area assesses whether the organization\u2019s data architecture \u2014 including operational data, transactional data, machine data, documents and knowledge \u2014 is ready to be consumed by AI models. A company cannot achieve AI maturity without achieving maturity in this area first.
