# SYSTEM CONTRACT
## User Journey, Mental States and System Integrity

This system is NOT a tool.
This system is NOT a feature set.
This system is NOT a sales funnel.

This system is a structured thinking environment
designed to guide a user from curiosity
to collective, data-informed decision-making.

The system does not optimize for:
- conversion
- activation
- feature usage

The system optimizes for:
- understanding
- trust
- mental clarity
- quality of decisions

---

## CORE PRINCIPLE

The user NEVER buys an account.
The user CREATES a decision-making space (organization).

The system does not onboard users.
The system TRANSITIONS mental states.

---

## USER ENTRY ASSUMPTIONS

- The user is often sceptical.
- The user has seen "AI promises" before.
- The user does not trust dashboards.
- The user values time and intellectual honesty.

The system must respect this.

---

## PHASE-BASED ARCHITECTURE

The system operates in strictly separated phases.
Each phase represents a DIFFERENT user mindset.

Phases must NEVER overlap.
Transitions between phases are explicit and intentional.

---

## PHASE A — PRE-ENTRY (PUBLIC)

Purpose:
- build category understanding
- remove hype
- reduce scepticism

Rules:
- NO selling
- NO features
- NO promises
- NO AI "magic" claims

Allowed:
- narrative framing
- one North Star sentence
- one CTA only

CTA:
"See how it works"

Exit condition:
User chooses to enter DEMO SESSION.

---

## PHASE B — DEMO SESSION (LOGGED, NO DATA)

Purpose:
- show the full system
- explain the method
- demonstrate AI style and restraint

Rules:
- READ-ONLY
- reference data only
- session-based context
- no persistence

User:
- logged in (OAuth or email)
- no organization
- no ownership

AI:
- narrator
- explainer
- guide
- NOT fully interactive

CTA:
"Let's do this for your company"

Exit condition:
User consciously chooses to engage.

---

## PHASE C — TRIAL ENTRY (TRUSTED ACCESS)

Purpose:
- move from observing to acting
- preserve selectivity and seriousness

Entry conditions:
- invitation code
- referral
- consultant invite
- team invite

Rules:
- limited actions
- no organization yet
- trial constraints active

Key user decision:
"I am ready to spend time thinking seriously."

Exit condition:
User is ready to work on real context.

---

## PHASE D — ORGANIZATION SETUP (MENTAL SHIFT)

Purpose:
- shift perspective from "me" to "we"
- create decision space

Critical rule:
User does NOT buy a plan.
User CREATES an organization.

Steps:
1. organization name
2. user role
3. context (company / consultant)

Effect:
- persistent system memory starts
- AI receives stable context
- decisions become collective

Exit condition:
Organization exists.

---

## PHASE E — GUIDED FIRST VALUE (DRD CORE)

Purpose:
- deliver real value fast
- create the first "AHA" moment

Rules:
- NOT full system
- NOT all features
- guided only

Mechanism:
- AI-led dialogue
- max 5–7 questions
- explanation for every question

AI:
- suggests DRD axes
- sets sequence
- explains logic

Outcome:
- DRD snapshot
- first insight
- sense of clarity

Exit condition:
User understands the method and its value.

---

## PHASE F — TEAM EXPANSION (INSIDE GROWTH)

Purpose:
- natural growth
- multi-perspective thinking

Trigger:
"This decision requires more than one perspective."

Actions:
- invite 2–3 people
- comments
- discussion
- shared axes

Effect:
- system becomes alive
- value increases without marketing

---

## PHASE G — ECOSYSTEM PARTICIPATION

Purpose:
- long-term value
- network effects
- benchmarking

User:
- recommends system because it:
  - helps thinking
  - improves conversations
  - saves time

Mechanisms:
- referral codes
- consultant mode
- benchmarks
- AI reviews

---

## FINAL RULE

If a feature does not clearly belong to a phase,
it must not exist.

If a behavior breaks phase boundaries,
it is a bug — not a UX issue.
