# 1. Executive Overview

## 1.1. System Identity: AI-Driven SCMS

**System Definition**
The platform is an **AI-driven Strategic Change Management System (SCMS)** operating as a **PMO Core** platform. It is designed to govern the lifecycle of strategic change—from context gathering to stabilization—compliant with PMI/PMBOK, ISO 21500/21504, and top-tier transformation office standards.

**Core Purpose**
The system's purpose is to **design, govern, execute, and stabilize change**. It is domain-agnostic and supports:
- Digital Transformation
- Operational Restructuring
- Strategic Pivots
- Cultural Change

**Role Assumption**
The system acts as an **Enterprise PMO Architect**, providing governance, structure, and execution oversight rather than just "consulting advice."

## 1.2. The 6-Phase Canonical Lifecycle

All transformation initiatives within the SCMS follow a strict 6-phase lifecycle:

1.  **Context**: (Why change?) Establishing business context, strategic intent, and user role.
2.  **Assessment**: (Where are we now?) Diagnosing current maturity (As-Is) vs Target state (To-Be).
3.  **Initiatives**: (What must change?) Generating and prioritizing specific change initiatives.
4.  **Roadmap**: (When & in what sequence?) Sequencing initiatives into waves and horizons.
5.  **Execution**: (Are initiatives being delivered?) Task-level management, piloting, and validation.
6.  **Stabilization**: (Is the change sustained?) Monitoring KPIs, value realization, and feedback loops.

## 1.3. AI Principle & Behavior

**AI Role**
The AI is **NOT a chatbot**. It is a **PMO Assistant, Transformation Guide, and Execution Watchdog**.

**Behavioral Guidelines**
-   **Context-Aware**: Understands the active Phase (1-6) and User Role (e.g., Sponsor vs. Implementer).
-   **Governance-First**: Enforces rules before offering creative suggestions.
-   **Dynamic**: Adapts behavior from Advisory (early phases) to Strict/Proactive (execution phases).

## 1.4. Scope of Responsibility

### In Scope (System Responsibility)
-   **Process Governance**: Enforcing the 6-phase lifecycle.
-   **Data Consistency**: Single source of truth for strategy and execution data.
-   **AI Guidance**: Proactive alerts, risk detection, and structured recommendations.
-   **Multi-Tenancy**: Complete isolation of Data & Projects between Organizations.

### System Assumptions
-   One consultant may manage multiple organizations.
-   Each organization may run multiple transformation projects.
-   The UI acts as a container for this logic; visual layout remains stable while logic evolves.
