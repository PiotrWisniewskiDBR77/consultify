## Production Floor Observations (RapidLean)

### Overview
Production Floor Observations (Gemba Walk) is an automated data collection method for RapidLean assessments. Operators use standardized templates on the production floor to document observations, which are automatically mapped to RapidLean scores and DRD maturity levels.

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ Automated data input - no manual questionnaire entry
- ✅ Evidence-based assessment with photos and notes
- ✅ Automatic mapping to DRD Axes 1 (Processes) and 5 (Culture)
- ✅ Comprehensive PDF report generation (DBR77 format)
- ✅ Mobile-friendly interface for operators

### Workflow: From Observations to Report

#### Step 1: Start Observation Session
1. Navigate to **Assessment → RapidLean → Production Observations**
2. Click **"Start Production Floor Observation"**
3. System displays 6 observation templates to complete

#### Step 2: Complete Observation Templates
You'll complete 6 standardized templates (estimated time: 60-90 minutes total):

1. **Value Stream Observation** (15 min)
   - Observe value stream flow from order to delivery
   - Maps to DRD Axis 1: Processes (Areas 1A, 1B, 1C)

2. **Waste Identification** (20 min)
   - Identify and document the 7+1 wastes
   - Maps to DRD Axis 1: Processes (Area 1C)

3. **Flow & Pull Systems** (15 min)
   - Observe Kanban, WIP limits, batch sizes
   - Maps to DRD Axis 1: Processes (Area 1C)

4. **Quality at Source** (15 min)
   - Observe Poka-Yoke, Andon, quality culture
   - Maps to DRD Axis 1: Processes (Area 1B)

5. **Continuous Improvement** (10 min)
   - Observe Kaizen boards, suggestion systems
   - Maps to DRD Axis 5: Culture (Area 5A)

6. **Visual Management** (10 min)
   - Observe KPIs, standards, visual controls
   - Maps to DRD Axis 5: Culture (Area 5B)

#### Step 3: Fill Out Each Template
For each template:
- **Answer checklist questions**: Yes/No, Scale (1-5), Text, Measurements

### Tips for Effective Observations

**Before Starting:**
- ✅ Review templates beforehand to understand what to look for
- ✅ Ensure mobile device is charged and has camera access
- ✅ Plan observation route through production floor
- ✅ Coordinate with production team (if needed)

**During Observations:**
- ✅ Be thorough - answer all required questions
- ✅ Take clear, well-lit photos
- ✅ Document specific examples (not just "yes/no")
- ✅ Note timestamps and locations accurately
- ✅ Use notes field for context and details

**After Completion:**
- ✅ Review generated assessment for accuracy
- ✅ Download PDF report for sharing
- ✅ Use DRD mapping to identify improvement areas
- ✅ Generate initiatives based on gaps identified

### FAQ: Production Floor Observations

**Q: How long does a complete observation session take?**
A: Estimated 60-90 minutes for all 6 templates. Each template takes 10-20 minutes.

**Q: Can I pause and resume observations?**
A: Yes! System auto-saves every 30 seconds. You can return to incomplete templates.

**Q: What if I don't have photos?**
A: Photos are required for most templates. Use your mobile device camera or upload existing photos.

**Q: How are observations mapped to DRD?**
A: System automatically converts:
- Observation answers → RapidLean scores (1-5 scale)
- RapidLean scores → DRD levels (1-7 scale)
- Uses evidence from photos/notes for enhanced mapping

**Q: Can I edit observations after submission?**
A: Once assessment is generated, you can create a new assessment with updated observations.

**Q: How do observations integrate with initiatives?**
A: Observations provide evidence for DRD gaps, which feed into the Initiative Generator. Observations are treated as evidence for initiatives.
