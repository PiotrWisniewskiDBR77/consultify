# DRD METHODOLOGY
## Decision Readiness Diagnosis

DRD is not an assessment.
DRD is not a maturity score.
DRD is a structured thinking framework.

Purpose:
- reveal decision readiness
- surface blind spots
- structure conversations

DRD is always:
- contextual
- incomplete by design
- revisitable

## CORE PRINCIPLES

1. No axis exists in isolation.
2. Scores are secondary to insights.
3. Discussion > measurement.
4. Clarity > completeness.

## AXIS LOGIC

Each axis represents a decision capability.
Each axis has:
- qualitative meaning
- observable signals
- discussion prompts

Axes are:
- suggested by AI
- ordered intentionally
- never forced all at once
