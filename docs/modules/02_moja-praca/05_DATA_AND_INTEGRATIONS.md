# Data & Integrations — Moja Praca / My Work

## Purpose

Define module objects, integrations and lineage responsibilities.

## Core Objects

- References tasks, decisions, artifacts, radar signals, calendar events and notes by link, not by duplicating source records.
- Radar items must keep source, trust, freshness and recommendation strength.

## Must

- MUST keep stable identifiers for durable objects.
- MUST preserve source/provenance when objects are generated, imported, exported or converted.
- MUST record integration calls and important transformations with enough metadata for audit.

## Must Not

- MUST NOT duplicate another module's canonical object as an independent source of truth.
- MUST NOT expose raw sensitive payloads where summaries/source links are sufficient.

## Should

- SHOULD prefer links and ownership references over copied data.
- SHOULD make stale or partial data visible to the UI layer.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Every durable object has owner module, source/provenance and lifecycle state where applicable.
- [ ] Cross-module handoff preserves lineage.
- [ ] Integration failures do not corrupt local canonical state.
