Consultify is structured into sequential modules that guide the user through the transformation process.

## 1. Dashboard (The Command Center)
The central hub providing a real-time overview of the transformation status.
- **Before Start**: Onboarding mode with step-by-step guidance.
- **During Project**: Live metrics, progress tracking across phases, and AI-driven alerts.

## 2. Expectations & Challenges (Module 1)
Defines the "Why" and "What" of the transformation.
- **Step 1.1**: Strategic goals definition.
- **Step 1.2**: User interviews and pain point collection.
- **Output**: A calibrated "Transformation Context" used by AI for future recommendations.

## 3. Assessment (Module 2)
The diagnostic core of the platform.
- **Questionnaires**: Detailed assessment across 5 dimensions (Strategy, Technology, Operations, Data, Culture).
- **Scoring**: Automated calculation of the DRD (Digital Readiness Degree).
- **Visualization**: Radar charts and heatmaps showing maturity gaps.

## 4. Initiatives & Roadmap (Module 3)
Turning insights into action.
- **Initiative Generation**: AI suggests projects based on assessment gaps.
- **Prioritization**: Drag-and-drop matrix (Impact vs. Effort).

## 5. Pilot Execution (Module 4)
Testing solutions in a controlled environment.
- **Pilot Selection**: Choosing a low-risk, high-impact area.

## 7. AI Consultant Insights
A pervasive feature available throughout the app.
- **Context Awareness**: The AI "knows" your assessment scores and active initiatives.
- **Q&A**: Ask questions like "Why is my Operations score low?" or "Draft a memo to the board about this risk."
