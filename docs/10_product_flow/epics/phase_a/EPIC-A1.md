| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Epic ID** | EPIC-A1 |
| **Phase** | A — Pre-Entry |
| **User State** | `ANON` |
| **Priority** | CRITICAL |
| **Non-Negotiable** | YES |

## Intent

This epic exists to establish **intellectual credibility** before any relationship is formed.

The system must frame the problem space in a way that proves **depth of understanding**, not superiority of solution.

> **Success Metric:** User understands why the category exists, NOT what the product does.

---

## User Context

At this stage the user:
- Is **highly sceptical** toward AI products
- Expects **exaggeration** and hidden sales agendas
- Is evaluating credibility **subconsciously**, not consciously

## System Requirements

### MUST
- [ ] Explain the structural problem of decision-making in complex organizations
- [ ] Position the system as a **thinking framework**, not a solution
- [ ] Avoid proposing tools, features, or outcomes

### MUST NOT
- [ ] Reference features, modules, dashboards
- [ ] Promise efficiency, speed, ROI, or results
- [ ] Mention future steps or benefits

---

## AI Behavior

> **AI must not be present.**

No AI references, interactions, or suggestions at this stage.
