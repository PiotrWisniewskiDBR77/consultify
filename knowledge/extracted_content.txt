47. Tool 3: The Digital Roadmap: plan and do it right
Having  used the Megatrend Tracker to examine the changes happening in 
the market, shifts in customer expectations, the evolution of production 
processes, and innovations in sales channels and in products themselves, it is 
now time to take action. We must now look at how to apply those learnings to 
your company so that you can identify appropriate strategic objectives and the 
routes towards achieving them.
Through my experience as a general manager in manufacturing companies 
and as the founder and CEO of a technology company, I have distilled key 
insights into creating a digital transformation strategy. From now on, we will 
be focusing on how to build, implement and, most importantly, execute a 
comprehensive digital transformation plan. Digital transformation is not just 
a set of trends you hear about at industry conferences: concrete steps forward 
are crucial. I will now guide you through the process of successfully creating, 
implementing and executing an effective and efficient plan that delivers 
tangible results.
The Digital Roadmap is a tool that integrates methodologies from both 
strategic consulting and operational reorganization project methodologies. 
This unique combination makes the tool both effective and flexible. Working 
with the Digital Roadmap involves three key steps: analysing the current 
state of the organization, developing a list of transformation initiatives, and 
building a coherent internal plan to implement these initiatives, including 
estimating their economic effects. Using the Digital Roadmap can guarantee 
the success of a transformation, but only if it is implemented and managed as 
a transformation process.
Let us start by addressing three fundamental principles on how to build a 
digital transformation plan such as the Digital Roadmap for an organization. 
First, the plan must encompass all aspects of digital transformation; as we 
have seen from numerous examples, a company can no longer focus solely on 
its product and assume that market dynamics will remain static. Therefore, the 
digital transformation plan must cover a wide range of changes both within 
and beyond the organization. Second, digital transformation is an ongoing 
Digital Pathfinder
416  
process; technological and business trends and increased global competition 
will ensure that digital transformation will now never truly end. Transformation 
is not a goal; rather, it is an approach that requires a complete shift in how 
we manage processes. Third, digital transformation involves the creation of 
various parallel pathways. Analysis of transformation trends across industries 
and companies has identified typical development pathways. Even having 
created a proper Digital Roadmap, you should be prepared that, within a few 
months, it may need modifying to account for technological changes that have 
emerged in the meantime.
To ensure that the transformation plan is coherent and covers all aspects of 
organizational transformation, it is divided into six major areas, which I have 
called ‘ the six axes of digital transformation’. They are, in brief: process 
digitalization, digital products, digital business models, data management, a 
culture of transformation, and cybersecurity. This division into six axes is an 
essential part of an effective digital transformation plan as it offers several 
benefits. It allows for better comprehension, management and implementation 
of the digital transformation process. 
Why are these six digital axes so significant? Firstly, they provide an organized 
structure for all the main areas of transformation. It is crucial to take all aspects 
of your company`s operations into account if you are to precisely identify what 
work is needed and where. This avoids inadvertently omitting vital elements 
and enhances the effectiveness of the transformation. Secondly, the division 
into axes provides the ability to see coherent sequences of actions. This means 
that you can plan and implement initiatives and changes in a coordinated way, 
taking into account the dependencies between different areas. For instance, 
changes in products can affect production processes, which can have a knock-
on effect on organizational structure, and this interconnectedness can quickly 
produce confusion. Chaos can only be avoided by adopting a structured 
paradigm, and that is what the six axes provide. Thirdly, each endeavour 
must be assessed in terms of the competencies it demands. Each of the digital 
axes requires specific skills and knowledge, so it is crucial to identify the 
competencies needed for developing and implementing initiatives in each 
area. This helps manage human resources more effectively and focuses efforts 
on developing the appropriate skills within the organization.
Piotr Wisniewski, PhD
417
However, I cannot overemphasize the fact that all the digital axes are equally 
important to your organization. A common mistake made by leaders during 
transformation is to assume that certain areas are not relevant to their company. 
This assumption is dangerous. Every company, whatever its industry or size, 
must consider all these areas. Digital transformation affects the entire economy 
and all players. Companies that trivialize certain areas are left unprepared for 
unexpected and unfavourable market changes. There is reason to think that, 
for a car, the engine and steering wheel are more fundamental to our power to 
decide where we go than the brakes are. After all, we use the brakes when we 
have to, but the accelerator and steering wheel are the primary mechanisms by 
which we determine where we go, which is what a car is for . But we obviously 
won` t stay alive on the road if we ignore the brakes. Similarly, the axes of 
processes, digital products and digital business models are the ones through 
which we drive our company, but if we ignore the axis of, say, cybersecurity, 
we won`t survive long.

Digital Pathfinder
418  
The  six digital axes form the foundation of an effective digital transformation 
plan, but they also provide tools for managing action sequences, competencies 
and resources. In the continuation of this chapter, I will present each axis of 
digital transformation in turn. I recommend that readers refer to the appendix 
at the back of the book. It includes example rating scales for all axes and 
describes areas to assess. If you find that any areas or terminology are unclear, 
I invite you to return to parts A and B of this book, where all necessary concepts 
and methods have been described.
Axis 1. Processes.  The first axis of digital transformation is  focused on 
Digital Processes. Processes are the backbone of your  organization, as they 
determine how strategies are executed and how  customer needs are met. 
These include sequences of interrelated actions  or operations planned and 
executed to achieve specific outcomes, such  as sales, marketing, technology 
and R&D, procurement, logistics, production , quality management, financial 
management, and human resource management.
Digitalizing these  processes means more than just incorporating new 
technologies; it requires  a comprehensive strategy to fundamentally transform 
the company`s internal  operations. This transformation is pivotal because 
it enhances organizational efficiency , improves agility, and strengthens 
competitiveness. For each process area, the  digital transformation involves 
several levels of digital maturity, starting from  basic data recording to full 
automation and AI support. For  instance, the progression in sales processes 
is from simple electronic  registration of agreements and orders to using AI 
to personalize  customer interactions and predict sales trends. Similarly, in 
manufacturing, digital  tools range from the basic capture of data on operations  
to the use of advanced Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) to  optimize 
production workflows.
The evaluation framework for this transformation is  structured around a seven-
level digital development scale. This scale  helps organizations identify their 
current stage of digital maturity in  various processes and guides them towards 
higher levels of precision , efficiency and data integration. The ultimate goal 
is to create  a seamless flow of information and enhanced collaboration across 
all  areas of the organization. By systematically upgrading each process, 
Piotr Wisniewski, PhD
419
organizations  can not only improve their operational efficiencies but also 
ensure  that they are adaptable to the future challenges posed by  technological 
progress and market dynamics. This axis is not just  about incremental 
improvements but about rethinking and redesigning processes to  drive 
fundamental changes that will sustain your business in the  digital age.
Axis 2. Digital products. Within this significant domain of the digital 
transformation of organizations, you will assess to what extent the company 
is already offering digital products. Business portfolios that already contain 
digital products can be further developed and refined. Attention can be focused 
on enhancing these products into more advanced market forms, increasing 
their appeal to customers, and opening new revenue streams.
Key areas of interest within this axis include the extent to which products 
can adopt an electronic form. Another important consideration is the ability 
to build products based on a community structure that fosters engaged, loyal 
customers. Equally significant is the extent to which the company is associated 
with the ICT industry, which can influence innovation and competitiveness. 
Product personalization is also gaining increasing importance, warranting 
reflection on how to tailor offerings to individual customer needs. Another 
critical aspect is product scalability – the capacity to meet growing demand 
through increased production or service provision.
Digital products change the way value is delivered to customers but also open 
up new avenues for satisfying needs, often involving both the creation and 
resolution of needs. Digital products frequently represent rapidly growing 
supplementary revenue sources for traditional companies.
Axis 3. Digital business models. Axis 3 explores the evolution  of Digital 
Business Models, reshaping how companies generate value and  interact within 
their markets. These models leverage digital capabilities to  meet evolving 
economic demands and consumer preferences, marking a significant  shift 
from traditional business strategies. It is essential to assess  your company`s 
position concerning these traditional models if you  are to understand and 
determine how to implement innovative alternatives . This assessment spans 
five key areas, each representing transformative strategies  for adapting to the 
digital era.
Digital Pathfinder
420  
The e-commerce sales  model, for instance, has transformed retail by 
expanding market reach  and reducing costs through digital means. Similarly, 
platform models create  expansive ecosystems that facilitate collaboration and 
exchange among various providers  and customers, enhancing service delivery 
and user engagement with potent  network effects. The shift to As-a-Service 
models allows  companies to offer continuous value through subscription-
based services, fostering  long-term customer relationships. Additionally, 
asset sharing enables organizations to  pool resources, maximizing efficiency 
and cost-effectiveness. Lastly, the strategy  of data monetization exploits the 
extensive data that companies collect , turning them into a substantial revenue 
source and actionable business  insights.
These models collectively advocate for the more dynamic, interconnected  
and scalable business operations that are crucial for success in  a digitally-
driven marketplace. Despite their significant benefits, digital business  models 
are often underappreciated. In my experience, companies are often  reluctant 
to embrace these new models, with fewer than twenty  per cent of projects 
successfully convincing organizations to innovate their  market approach. 
Thus, attention to this axis is crucial if  you are to integrate these new models 
into your overarching  strategy and fully realize your potential.
Axis 4. Data management . The digital revolution is fundamentally data-
centric, underscoring the importance of data as a critical component of any 
transformation strategy. In today`s environment, modern companies, regardless 
of industry or size, are accumulating vast amounts of data. However, merely 
collecting large volumes of data is not sufficient; the quality of data and their 
effective management are equally crucial.
For organizations, acknowledging the pivotal role of data is essential. Data 
can be a significant source of knowledge and competitive advantage when 
managed wisely. Advanced technologies now enable data to be collected, 
stored, analysed, and utilized in innovative ways that were not previously 
possible.
Data analysis forms an integral part of digital transformation, covering 
several key aspects that collectively enhance an organization`s capability to 
leverage data effectively. It starts with data collection, where information is 
Piotr Wisniewski, PhD
421
systematically gathered from both internal and external sources, ensuring 
a comprehensive dataset for analysis. This step is followed by secure 
and compliant data storage, crucial for maintaining the integrity and 
confidentiality of data while addressing security and regulatory compliance 
issues. Data communication also plays a critical role, involving the efficient 
transmission and sharing of data within the organization to enable accessible 
and collaborative analysis.
Moreover, analysing Big Data allows organizations to derive deeper insights 
from extensive datasets, significantly influencing strategic decision-making 
and operational efficiencies. The use of computational technologies is vital 
for efficient data management, enabling the rapid processing and analysis of 
large volumes of data, thereby supporting more informed and timely business 
decisions.
Together, these elements create a robust framework for harnessing the power 
of data, which constitutes a significant portion of digital transformation. The 
proper collection, processing and utilization of data enables organizations to 
achieve superior results, make more informed decisions, and respond more 
agilely to market changes. This axis supports but also drives organizational 
success in the digital age.
Axis 5. Culture of transformation. Organizational culture is the collection 
of values and beliefs that members of the organization hold and the daily 
behaviours prevalent within the organization. It influences how employees 
make decisions, collaborate with each other and respond to changes. Without 
the appropriate shift in organizational culture, even the best- planned strategy 
may not yield the desired effects. 
Organizational culture is evaluated based on several critical areas that 
collectively influence the success of transformation initiatives within a 
company. Preferred leadership styles are pivotal in shaping the culture and 
behaviour of employees; leaders who encourage openness, flexibility and 
empowerment can significantly drive forward the cultural shifts needed 
for transformation. Additionally, an organization`s readiness for change is 
essential, as it enhances the likelihood that new processes will be adopted 
and integrated successfully, which will translate directly into the effectiveness 
Digital Pathfinder
422  
of the transformation process. Furthermore, fostering a habit of continuous 
improvement within the company culture can lead to greater flexibility and 
competitiveness, enabling the organization to respond swiftly and effectively 
to evolving market demands and technological advancements. A culture that 
vigorously supports and drives innovation is also crucial because it determines 
an organization`s ability to adopt and implement new solutions and ideas 
promptly. 
Lastly, the availability of resources, including financial and human capital, 
critically shapes the organizational culture. Sufficient resources ensure that 
transformation plans are not only envisioned but also effectively executed, 
facilitating a smoother transition and better alignment with strategic 
objectives. Together, these factors create a robust framework for assessing 
and cultivating an organizational culture that supports energetic growth and 
sustained transformation.
Axis 6. Cybersecurity.  In the era of rapid  technological progress and 
increasing cyber threats, the security of data , IT systems and infrastructure 
is paramount for safeguarding company interests  and maintaining customer 
trust. Cybersecurity is an integral part of  a digital transformation strategy, 
aimed at ensuring secure, sustainable growth  while constructing a positive 
image as a dependable business partner  committed to protecting the data and 
information of its stakeholders . With cybercrimes such as hacking, data theft 
and ransomware attacks  having severe repercussions for companies and their 
customers, the responsibility  to shield against both financial and reputational 
damage has never  been more crucial.
Axis 6 addresses the comprehensive measures and  practices necessary to 
protect an organization`s digital infrastructure and  sensitive information. It 
includes strategy and risk management, which involves  assessing potential 
threats and devising effective mitigation strategies. The protection  of networks 
and systems is critical, requiring robust security protocols  to safeguard against 
unauthorized access and cyber-attacks. Data security  is also essential, focusing 
on protecting data integrity and privacy  from breaches and theft. Additionally, 
education and training are vital  to equip employees with the skills needed 
to recognize and  proactively respond to cybersecurity threats. Emergency 
Piotr Wisniewski, PhD
423
planning is another integral  component, preparing the organization to swiftly 
handle and recover from  security incidents.
This holistic approach to cybersecurity is essential for  the integrity and 
resilience of any modern organization facing evolving  cyber threats. In our 
fast-paced digital revolution, it is  easy to overlook the need to adequately 
secure digital assets . Therefore, organizations must devise comprehensive 
risk management strategies that encompass  network and system protection, 
data security and proactive employee education  to ensure a well-prepared 
contingency plan for responding swiftly  to any attack or security breach. This 
proactive and inclusive  approach to cybersecurity ensures that organizations 
not only defend against  immediate threats but also foster a culture of 
continuous vigilance  and improvement.
As seen in the approach to digital transformation , the six axes describe all 
aspects of change relating to  both the enterprise`s business performance 
and its organizational structure . This approach is designed to ensure that the 
transformation programme  based on the Digital Roadmap is comprehensive 
and holistic. Additionally , it is important to remember that the effectiveness 
and efficiency  with which this programme is implemented will depend on the  
coherence of the initiatives it contains.
In the first step , you will need to assess the current level of digitalization  
across all six axes and all the areas described within  them. From experience, 
I know that self-assessing your own  company usually results in much higher 
ratings than when the  assessment is carried out by an external specialist; a 
company  assessing itself will tend to paint an overly rosy picture  that is not 
brutally honest enough to serve as a  sound foundation on which to build a 
successful transformation. A  warts-and-all picture is best taken by external 
specialists  leading the management team through a structured conversation 
that systematically  reviews the entire organization. The outcome of this first 
step  is a set of assessment scores that cover all areas  of all axes of digital 
transformation. This matrix of scores  constitutes your assessment of your 
company`s level of maturity  level before any changes are implemented.
The second step involves  creating lists of transformation initiatives for all 
areas of all  digital transformation axes. In practice, this action is relatively 
Digital Pathfinder
424  
simple , as the assessment matrices drawn up in step one have  very obvious 
implications; your initiatives will be little more than  proposals for achieving 
the next levels of digital maturity. For  example, if in the first axis your 
company was rated  at level three in the first area, which is sales  processes, we 
can automatically assume that the next steps of  development are levels four 
and five. Proceeding in this way  with all areas of all digital transformation 
axes, we create  from forty to even fifty transformation initiatives.
In the third  step, we proceed to connect initiatives into sets of actions  that 
should be carried out together and to arrange these  sets in a timeline. It 
is extremely important here that  t h e  i n i t i a t i v e s  b e  c o h e r e n t  a n d  l o g i c a l  
and that their implementation  be sequenced for success. For example, if 
we have initiatives  related to influencing organizational culture and data 
collection systems, these  i n i t i a t i v e s  s h o u l d  c e r t a i n l y  p r e c e d e  i n i t i a t i v e s  
related to the construction of  advanced algorithmic solutions supporting 
digital processes or products. It is  obvious that, before we start investing 
and working, it is  necessary to build the appropriate knowledge plan 
and acquire the  r e q u i r e d  r e s o u r c e s .  O n c e  t h e  s c h e d u l e  d e s c r i b i n g  t h e  
implementation of actions  o v e r  t h e  n e x t  t h r e e  t o  f o u r  y e a r s  i s  r e a d y ,  i t 
is worthwhile estimating the economic effects of the developed plan . 
From experience, I know that no transformation, whether understood as  
a strategic or operational programme, can succeed if the stakeholders  of 
the organization do not support it. And of course , in the case of long-
term transformation plans, any attempt  to create precise assumptions for 
financial models will be exceedingly  inefficient and inaccurate at first. It 
is therefore all the  more important to start early; early attempts will always 
be  rough-and-ready , and it is necessary to allow for  the time it takes for 
successive iterations to become steadily  more precise.
Thus prepared, the Digital Roadmap allows us to  take action. This plan 
can and should be verified and  adjusted on the fly to changing external and 
internal circumstances . The plan is, in its essence, a multitude of initiatives  
that together contribute to the achievement of the goal. Therefore , if your next 
update to the Megatrend Tracker or any  other event renders the assumptions 
of the transformation plan out  of date, it is always possible to proceed by 
identifying  only those transformation initiatives that need to be modified. 
Piotr Wisniewski, PhD
425
This  capacity to adjust selectively to changes means that your transformation  
strategy sets the direction and establishes main activities while ensuring  
flexibility and readiness for change.
In following the three simple  s t e p s  o u t l i n e d  a b o v e ,  t h e r e  a r e  s e v e r a l  
considerations to keep in  mind, and we shall outline these here.
Firstly, remember that  the Digital Roadmap is a tool that supports digital 
transformation  as a process, not a one-time project. Therefore, it  is intended 
for use in regularly reviewing the company`s  digitalization level and the 
effectiveness of transformation initiatives. In practice , I perform an audit 
with my clients or suggest a  self-assessment at three-month intervals, because 
the hyperreal world  is so changeable that strategic assumptions are worth 
reviewing even  four times a year.
Secondly, a transformation plan needs to  maintain a balance between the 
present and the future. It  is crucial to consider both current business-oriented 
actions and  those directed towards long-term strategy. Overemphasizing 
either of these  aspects can have negative consequences. Overly focusing on 
the future  may result in a loss of competitiveness. Conversely, excessively 
concentrating  on the present may cause you to neglect critical opportunities  
for change.
Thirdly, the digital transformation plan should not be  limited to business-
related activities. Changes must also encompass products , processes and 
business models, as well as organizational structure. If  business transformation 
is not preceded by changes in organizational culture , employee education, 
data management and cybersecurity, the company can be  exposed to risk and 
inefficiency. Thus, business and organizational aspects  need to be worked on 
in sync to ensure harmonious  development.
Next, digital transformation plans must maintain a healthy balance  between 
planning and action. Many companies undertake hasty actions without  
adequate preparation and planning, which can eventually lead to issues . 
Transformational actions must be built on solid foundations, which include  
understanding the directions of transformation, proper data management and 
having  a culture of digital transformation in place. Although actions can  take 
Digital Pathfinder
426  
effect more quickly if this groundwork is skipped, the  lack of attention can 
threaten the success of the entire  transformation. 
Further, the primary goal of digital transformation should include  both 
financial and social aspects. When creating a transformation plan , we 
often focus on initiatives promising financial benefits and a  p o s i t i v e  
return on investment. However, we must not forget the  social aspects. 
Transformation affects not only a company`s financial  performance but  
also its employees, customers and the wider community . Hence, it is 
equally important to consider social goals in  the decision-making process 
for a sustainable and effective transformation  that benefits the company 
and its environment alike.
A balance  must also be maintained between technology and human factors. 
We  are all excited about technological megatrends such as artificial 
intelligence , but business and social megatrends are equally important. When 
planning  transformation based on the six digital axes, we must consider  both 
technological initiatives and social changes.
Finally, we often concentrate  on the use of the latest technologies, but we must  
not forget that people are key actors and beneficiaries in  the transformation 
process. Thus, the transformation plan needs to encompass  both technological 
investments and the development of employee skills and  competencies. Any 
comprehensive picture of digital transformation will entail the  combination 
of these two factors.
In summary, then, when reviewing  an organization`s current state of 
digitalization, we first look  in detail at where the organization stands in terms 
of  each assessment area within each digital axis. These axes are  elaborated 
on in detail in the appendix to this book . This furnishes us with a total of 34 
partial assessments . Only by collecting and thoroughly analysing data on these 
can  we make an overall assessment of where the organization currently  lies 
along its digital transformation journey. To download the Digital  Roadmap 
tool, please visit www.dbr77.com/pathfinder.
This will  not only tell you where you stand on each axis  now; it will also 
provide a clear view of what  the next levels are in each area. Thus, the tool  
Piotr Wisniewski, PhD
427
also provides a clear foundation on which to draw up  a comprehensive and 
coherent set of transformation initiatives. Their implementation  will steer the 
company onto the right path of digital  transformation in a way that is logical 
and aligned with your strategy.

48. The digital leader: the transformation within
For  over twenty years, I have been working closely with manufacturing 
companies all over the world. This has involved hundreds of official and 
somewhat less formal conversations with leaders, managers and line workers, 
as well as consultants, advisors and scientists, about what it means to be a 
leader in these transformative times. These conversations have happened 
for the very prosaic and pragmatic reason that I have spent this time leading 
various companies, once mainly in manufacturing and now a technology 
startup, and working on the boards of various companies. It is therefore my 
professional duty to best serve the organizations and people I lead.
As you have read repeatedly throughout the preceding chapters, the era of 
digital transformation we are witnessing and participating in requires that 
we all put into effect radically new attitudes and competencies. We should 
all get used to the idea that things will no longer be as they were before. 
New territory awaits us and, as we forge onward, the obstacles it presents will 
only grow and the changes will only come more quickly. This chapter will 
first address what look set to remain the biggest challenges facing leaders at 
various levels of organizations in the coming years. In the second part, I will 
share my experiences as a change leader, talking about the duties that fall to 
every leader in the digital era.
It is difficult to definitively list the challenges that each of us faces. 
Nevertheless, many areas are common, and we all encounter them, some 
more consciously and others less so. It is worth identifying them because 
only by being conscious of them can we begin to look for solutions. Above 
all, this awareness is a prerequisite for our readiness for the change that 
must begin within ourselves. The mass digital transformation of the world 
is currently one of the biggest issues facing leaders at various levels. The 
transition to digital tools and processes is becoming increasingly important 
for organizational success. We live in times in which sticking to outdated 
methods and technologies can lead to a loss of competitiveness. Therefore, 
leaders must focus on managing this transformation and ensuring that the 
organization exploits new technologies to the full.

Appendix: The Digital Roadmap
This  appendix presents in detail the methodology I have been using for several 
years to define digital transformation paths. It is through this methodology that 
any company can determine where it currently stands and the path that will 
lead it through the changing landscape – a topic I have extensively discussed 
in this book.
The assessment matrix is based on the philosophy of control embodied in the 
automotive standard VDA 6.3 for assessing process excellence in companies. 
This method is especially useful in manufacturing and service industries, and 
it was designed to ensure safety and efficiency in supply chains. It allows 
a precise evaluation of the digital technologies currently implemented in 
different organizational areas, which aids in identifying areas requiring 
improvements or development and in making more informed decisions on 
investment in digital technologies. Ultimately, its use can help a company 
achieve greater efficiency, competitiveness and adaptation to market changes.
Each axis of the Digital Roadmap has a distinct role and describes a different 
objective; please keep in mind that all of them are equally important for a 
company. The areas of assessment and specific evaluation levels I propose 
are based solely on my experiences as a manager, consultant and lecturer. 
Companies are free to modify the assessment matrices I suggest. However, I 
caution against oversimplifying them. Contrary to what it might seem, a lower 
initial evaluation score is better, as it presents an opportunity for the company 
to further develop and enhance its competitiveness.
In this appendix, I will separately describe each axis of digital transformation 
that constitutes the roadmap. Starting with a brief introduction explaining the 
significance of each axis and the method used to determine the development 
levels within it, I will then outline the assessment rules set for each axis. 
Once these principles are established, I will detail the characteristics of each 
Digital Pathfinder
450  
evaluation level for the specific area. Please remember that in constructing 
such a complex assessment system, aimed at describing all types of enterprises, 
I had to employ certain simplifications and shortcuts. As a result, there may 
not be clear boundaries between individual levels. If this is the case for you, I 
suggest you rate your company as being on the lower level until you have met 
all the criteria of the higher level. This will give you greater motivation to act 
and make changes. As regards any lack of clarity between levels, as you return 
to use the tool later to assess what progress your initiatives have brought, you 
will assess and utilize it with greater ease and understanding.
If you find the assessment methodology and the creation of transformation 
initiatives outlined in this appendix unclear, I strongly advise you to return to 
the chapter ‘ Tool 3: The Digital Roadmap’, where I comprehensively discuss 
the objectives, significance and usage of this essential tool.

Axis 1: Digital processes
We begin with assessing digital processes. For a  business, a process is 
defined as any set of interrelated  and sequential actions or operations planned 
and executed to achieve  a specific outcome. Processes are crucial to the 
organization because  they define how its core activities and operations are 
performed . The great majority of a company`s processes are encompassed  
within the nine areas we deal with here, namely, the  seven core areas of sales, 
marketing, process technology and R &D, purchasing, logistics, production, 
and quality, and the two support  domains of finance and HR. 
Processes need to be well -defined, documented and optimized, as they 
determine the quality and  efficiency of an organization. Process optimization 
can save time, resources  and costs critical to competitiveness and success. 
Therefore, process management  is a pivotal component of business strategy 
that enhances organizations` operations and adaptability.

Digital Pathfinder
452  
Organizations  differ in their internal processes. Nevertheless, certain 
processes are fundamental to most companies, regardless of industry or 
size. The set of processes we will be discussing primarily derives from 
manufacturing companies that engage in the production of physical goods, but 
variations on these processes can be customized to each company`s specific 
activities. For non-manufacturing organizations, this list will be slightly 
different and tailored to their needs. However, the concept of evaluation and 
the use of this matrix remains the same.
The digital transformation of processes within an organization unfolds through 
a structured seven-level development matrix, each stage enhancing efficiency 
and responsiveness to both external customer needs and internal organizational 
requirements. As processes are more comprehensively digitalized, they not 
only become more cost-effective but also more precisely aligned with user 
demands. The seven levels of digital processes are as follows:
Basic Data Registration: At this initial  stage, systems are implemented to 
collect and store basic data  relevant to specific processes. Data entry may be 
manual, or  it can be automated through dedicated applications, with datasets 
integrated  and annotated for easy accessibility.
Workstation Control: Digital tools, both software and hardware, are 
installed at various workstations to enhance operational efficiency. This 
equipment enforces adherence to job descriptions and reduces process errors 
by streamlining tasks at each station.
Process Control: All workstations involved in a particular process are  linked 
through a unified management and control system, allowing for  detailed 
process planning, target setting and performance evaluation.
Automation: Automation tools are introduced based on data from individual 
workstations and the entire process. These tools automate tasks that are 
repetitive and critical for customer satisfaction or organizational stability, 
including physical movements and modifications of material properties.  
Industrial robots, collaborative robots (cobots) and automated guided 
vehicles (AGVs) are examples of such automation.
Piotr Wisniewski, PhD
453
Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES): MES solutions collect, 
analyse , and display information across large organizational areas, providing

Area 3A. Use of e-commerce models
In  the hyperreal world, numerous levels of e-commerce business models 
are shaping the landscape of trade. Online stores and e-commerce platforms 
are central to delivering products and services worldwide. These business 
models evolve gradually, from a basic level to advanced strategies based on 
personalization and the latest technologies.
Level 1. Basic. Online stores offer products or services through their own 
websites or popular e-commerce platforms like Amazon or eBay. Customers 
can choose from a variety of products, such as clothing, electronics or 
cosmetics, and make online purchases. This process involves adding products 
to a cart and making payments. Companies utilize basic sales applications to 
manage orders and track sales.
Level 2. Intermediate.  A n  e s s e n t i a l  s t e p  i s  i n t e g r a t i o n w i t h  v a r i o u s  
e-commerce platforms to enhance the visibility of  p r o d u c t s  o n  v a r i o u s  
platforms. Additionally, sales applications offer more advanced  t o o l s  
such as inventory management and sales data analysis. The  importance of 
offer personalization is greater at this level, and  products can be tailored to 
individual needs.
Level 3. Advanced . E-commerce stores continue to enhance their capabilities 
through further integration with various platforms, including marketplaces. 
More advanced visualization tools allow customers to, for example, view 
products in different colours or configurations. The personalizing of offers is 
more advanced at this stage, relying on customer purchase data and enabling 
customization, such as a choice of colours or engraving options. Advanced-
level stores may also use product recommendations based on customer 
purchasing behaviour to give them a competitive advantage.

in e-commerce, using state-of-the-art technologies and innovative approaches 
to customer service.
Piotr Wisniewski, PhD
487
Area 3B. Platform solutions
The  second assessment area focuses on the use of platform solutions in business 
models. These models, while offering significant competitive advantages and 
financial returns, are among the most complex to implement. They involve the 
creation of digital platforms that act as intermediaries, connecting service or 
product providers with customers and facilitating transactions within a digital 
ecosystem. Revenue is often generated through fees charged to either sellers 
or buyers. Successful platform models establish ecosystems where suppliers 
and customers collaborate and share knowledge, but they also require 
adaptation to market needs and robust support for ecosystem participants. 
Their complexity and need to be continuously adapted are what make these 
business models challenging to implement but also powerful means by which 
to secure lasting competitive advantages.
Level 1. Basic. An individual or company  uses a platform to conduct simple 
transactions, such as purchasing  or selling products or services. For example, 
a company might  use a B2B platform to optimize raw material purchases or  
to forecast prices.
Level 2. Intermediate. A company or institution provides a platform where 
sellers can offer products or services to customers. The platform may offer 
analytical tools to sellers and personalized recommendations to customers. An 
online gaming platform, for example, might provide access to games through 
a subscription or one-time payment.
Level 3. Advanced.  A company or  institution creates and manages an 
ecosystem, connecting suppliers, partners and  customers to create added value 
and synergy. They offer market  analysis tools, joint promotions and loyalty 
programmes. An example might  be an e-commerce platform integrating 
suppliers, partners and customers  while also offering market analysis.
Level 4. Advanced SEM.  In addition to facilitating transactional 
relationships, the owner provides Software- as-a-Service solutions on its 
platform, enabling access to various online applications and tools. This type 
of platform organization is referred to as a Software-as-a-Service Enabled 
Marketplace (SEM). SEM platforms offer diverse applications, from project 
Digital Pathfinder
488  
management to data analysis, with the option for customization and integration. 
An example might be a project management platform that provides access to 
various tools tailored to customer needs.
Level 5. Expert.  The highest-level platforms combine the functionalities 
of SEM  platforms with an active user community. This enables participants 
to  interact, collaborate and share knowledge. Companies combine SEM 
platforms with  forums and chats where users can share knowledge and resolve  
issues. For example, an IT platform might allow IT resource  management 
while also providing a space for collaboration and technical support for users.
Piotr Wisniewski, PhD
489
Area 3C. As-a-Service
The  third area of analysis is the As-a-Service business model, in which 
companies offer their solutions on a subscription or pay-per-use basis. In this 
model, the customer has access to the provider`s infrastructure, applications, 
tools and resources, allowing them to leverage advanced technologies and 
services and to pay only for what they actually consume. This model enables 
companies to save significant time and costs associated with maintaining 
infrastructure and employee teams. It also allows for flexible scalability and 
faster market innovation.
Level 1. Basic. The  company and its service provider enter into long-term 
service  agreements that resemble traditional partnerships. The provider offers 
a basic  service with an emphasis on availability and simplicity. The customer  
values the convenience and flexibility of using the service, even  though the 
service does not solve complex business problems. For  example, an electronics 
manufacturer collaborates with an external company to  run a basic online 
store and manage online product delivery . Customers can purchase products 
through the website, and the provider  facilitates basic e-commerce services.
Level 2. Intermediate.  The company and the service provider establish long-
term subscription or tariff-based agreements for service usage. The provider 
offers more advanced features and technical support. The customer expects 
consistent service quality throughout the contract period. Here, an example 
might be an electronics manufacturer collaborating with an external company 
that handles warehousing, packaging and product shipping on demand. 
The external operator is responsible for the product from the completion of 
production to delivery to the customer.
Level 3. Advanced. The customer  pays the service provider for the time they 
use available  assets or resources. The service provider focuses on managing 
and  maintaining assets for the customer`s needs, providing greater flexibility . 
Consider an electronics manufacturer that establishes a long-term partnership  
with an outsourcing company that manages various sales channels, including   
online stores, physical retail shops and online marketplaces. The outsourcing  
company also offers advanced analytical tools for sales monitoring.
Digital Pathfinder
490  
Level  4. Advanced personalization.  The customer pays a service provider 
to complete specific tasks or achieve precisely defined results. The provider 
adapts heavily to the customer`s individual needs and delivers personalized 
solutions. The customer expects a specialized and tailored approach from the 
provider. An electronics manufacturer might use an omnichannel platform 
that connects various sales channels, allowing personalized customer service 
at every stage. The platform integrates online stores, physical stores, mobile 
apps and real-time delivery.
Level 5. Expert.  Service providers act as the primary executor, managing 
the entire  customer business process. The customer leverages comprehensive 
business solutions offered  by the provider. This is the highest level of provider  
involvement in the customer`s business processes and might, for  example, 
entail an electronics manufacturer outsourcing solutions to experts in  
omnichannel. The collaboration includes comprehensive sales management, 
delivery, customer service  and high-level personalization. Services are fully 
tailored to the  customer`s needs and utilize advanced technologies. In this 
business  model, the level of digital maturity depends on the amount  of 
complexity and risk that is delegated to the service  provider. The technological 
aspect of this assessment indirectly concerns the  extent to which the service 
provider can monitor and manage the risks they undertake.
Piotr Wisniewski, PhD
491
Area 3D. Asset sharing models
Asset  sharing is gaining popularity as a business model in the era of digital 
transformation. It involves creating platforms that enable users to share 
various types of assets, whether virtual or physical, as well as knowledge and 
financial resources. This can not only efficiently utilize available resources 
but also create ecosystems where users can collaborate, exchange services 
and achieve their business goals.
Level 1. Basic. The platform allows users to  share virtual assets such as files, 
digital content, applications or  online services. Users can use these assets based 
on subscriptions , pay-per-use or platform access. For example, a platform  
might allow graphic designers to share tools and collaborate effectively  on 
projects, paying for access based on the number of  projects they create.
Level 2. Intermediate.  The platform enables users to share physical assets 
such as cars, properties, tools or equipment. Users can rent these assets from 
others for a specified duration, allowing them to save on purchasing or renting 
a full set of items. For instance, a bike- sharing platform allows users to rent 
bikes from other users on a subscription basis, providing them access to 
various types of bikes based on their needs.
Level 3. Advanced. The  platform allows users to share knowledge, skills, 
experience or the  product of intellectual work. Users can offer their services, 
conduct  training or share educational materials with other platform users. One  
example might be a platform for marketing professionals on which  experts 
offer their skills in data analysis and marketing strategy  to other platform 
users for an hourly fee.
Level 4 . Advanced personalization.  T h e  c u s t o m e r  p a y s  t h e  s e r v i c e  
provider for the time they use available assets or resources. The service 
provider focuses on managing and maintaining assets for the customer` s 
needs in order to increase the customer`s flexibility. Thus, an electronics 
manufacturer might enter into a long-term partnership with an outsourcing 
company that manages various sales channels, including online stores, 
physical retail shops and online marketplaces. The outsourcing company also 
offers advanced analytical tools for sales monitoring.
Digital Pathfinder
492  
Level 5. Expert.  The platform enables users to share complex  business 
solutions such as IT infrastructure, analytical tools, logistics services  or 
project management. Users can use these solutions on a  subscription or pay-
per-use basis, allowing them to reduce  the costs of their investments. An 
example might be a  platform that integrates various services and technologies 
to provide comprehensive  business solutions for project management, data 
analysis and logistics. Companies  can use these solutions on a subscription 
basis, allowing them  to devote the time and resources they save to developing 
their proprietary solutions.

Area 3E. Data monetization models
The  f i f t h  a r e a  i n  w h i c h  b u s i n e s s  m o d e l s  a r e  a s s e s s e d  f o r  digital maturity is  
data monetization models. These models centre on a company`s ability 
to generate financial revenue by collecting, analysing and utilizing data 
about customers or processes. These data constitute a crucial resource for 
understanding and serving customers and generating added value.
Level 1. Basic. The company collects data  from its customers, such as 
preferences, shopping behaviour and demographic  information. It uses the 
data to comprehend customers and enhance  its offerings. For example, auction 
platforms analyse purchase histories to  recommend to users products that may 
interest them.
Level 2 . Intermediate.  The company conducts more advanced analysis of the 
accumulated data to identify patterns, trends and opportunities. Data analysis 
helps it understand customers and make more informed business decisions. 
An example is Netflix, which analyses viewership data to identify trends and 
create more personalized recommendations for users.
Level 3. Advanced.  The company employs the gathered data to personalize 
offerings  to individual customers. This allows it to deliver customized products , 
services and content that align more closely with individual customer  needs 
and preferences. Spotify, for instance, analyses musical preferences to  provide 
users with personalized playlists and song recommendations.
Level 4 . Advanced personalization. The company uses the accumulated 
data as a valuable resource that can be sold, shared or used to generate 
additional revenue. This may involve sharing data with business partners, 
offering paid analytical services, or using data for advertising purposes. 
Facebook, for instance, sells data to advertisers, enabling them to target 
specific user groups.
Level 5. Expert. The  c o m p a n y  u s e s  i t s  g a t h e r e d  d a t a  t o  c r e a t e  n e w  
products, services  and innovative solutions. Data serve as the foundation 
for developing  new business models, crafting intelligent algorithms and 
harnessing artificial intelligence  to deliver more advanced solutions to

496  
Area 4A. Data collection
This  is a complex process involving various stages such as identifying the 
sources of data and collecting, validating and evaluating those data. This 
requires the right tools and technologies to ensure not only the high quality 
and reliability of the process but also the security and confidentiality of the 
gathered data. Another important component of the data collection system is 
its assessment and control of data quality, including of accuracy, completeness 
and consistency. It is also valuable to provide suitable procedures and tools 
for monitoring and analysing the data to understand organizational processes 
better and make decisions more effectively.
Level 1. Manual data collection.  This involves employees manually 
completing forms with information about their work or other activities related 
to the organization. These forms typically include information about tasks 
performed, working hours, equipment used, materials and tools employed 
by the employee, and work-related problems or incidents. The downside of 
manual declarations is that they are time-consuming and costly, requiring 
manual filling of documents by employees. They are also often prone to 
human error, which can degrade data quality and complicate analysis. An 
example of this level is a construction company using paper cards to track 
working hours and equipment usage. While a simple task, errors in records 
could lead to inaccuracies in project management.
Level 2. The use of graphic symbols. Such techniques as the use of barcodes  
or QR codes are popularly employed in warehouses, stores or  production to 
identify goods, products or devices using a scanner . Each product or device is 
graphically labelled, and its data  are stored in an IT system. Using a scanner, 
an  employee can quickly and precisely gather information about products or  
devices to ensure their smooth operation or to assist customers . In a large 
supermarket network, each product on the shelf  has a barcode. Employees 
use scanners for quick inventory counting  and receiving deliveries, thereby 
increasing efficiency and reducing errors.
Level  3. Advanced technological solutions.  Technologies such as Radio 
Frequency Identification (RFID) streamline operations and processes. 
Piotr Wisniewski, PhD
497
RFID enables the automatic identification and tracking of objects using 
radio waves. In manufacturing, this technology serves as a data collection 
system, significantly improving warehouse management, logistics and the 
monitoring of production processes. For example, in an automotive parts 
factory, the use of RFID tags is invaluable. The tags are used to track boxes 
containing car components. With this system, the organization can precisely 
monitor inventory availability, allowing for more efficient management. 
RFID technology not only improves efficiency but also enhances monitoring 
accuracy, eliminating human errors and providing better control over the 
organization`s resources.
Level 4. Data from manufacturing machines and devices.  A  key source 
of information is machines and devices equipped with  various sensors that 
measure a range of process parameters, such  as temperature, humidity, 
pressure, speed, rotations, vibrations and more. These  data are collected in 
real-time and processed in IT  systems, enabling continuous monitoring and 
analysis of production processes. For  example, beverage factories may use 
sensors to monitor temperature and  pressure in the pasteurization process. This 
data is analysed in  real-time by the system, which can adjust pasteurization 
parameters  on the fly. This ensures consistent product quality and minimizes  
the risk of failures.
Level 5. Mobile data collection devices  integrated into the production 
management and optimization process.  C r u c i a l  i n f o r m a t i o n c a n  b e  
gathered regarding employees` interactions with mobile applications and  
devices used to monitor their work. These data may include  information about 
employees` location, behaviours and preferences, and other relevant  factors. 
An example is the use of smartphones or specially  adapted devices that 
allow employees to be located within the  production plant and data related 
to their work to be  collected. For instance, these tools can monitor time spent 
at  specific machines, work efficiency and breaks taken. With these tools , 
manufacturing companies can refine their operations and effectively respond 
to  changing production conditions.
Level 6. Production data collected from physical  objects.  Modern sensors 
are increasingly recording various environmental parameters such as 
Digital Pathfinder
498  
temperature, humidity, pressure, light intensity or motion. The data that are 
collected are extremely valuable, as they can be used for various purposes 
such as monitoring working conditions, performing machine diagnostics 
and optimizing production processes. An excellent example is that of a food 
production factory using temperature and humidity sensors in its warehouse. 
These sensors constantly monitor product storage conditions, and the data 
they collect are transmitted to the appropriate software. This allows the 
company to meticulously track the quality of stored products. In case of any 
irregularities, such as inappropriate storage conditions, the software enables 
swift intervention, minimizing losses and ensuring high product quality.
Level 7. Optical control. This advanced approach to collecting data from 
physical objects uses cameras and other optical devices to monitor and assess 
the state of physical objects. Optical devices capture images of objects, which 
are then meticulously analysed for potential damages or other irregularities. 
Thus, cameras might be installed on the ceiling of a production or warehouse 
hall for real-time monitoring and identification of the activities that equipment 
is performing. These advanced cameras, equipped with sensors and image-
processing algorithms, track objects on the production line, identifying their 
position and actions. This intelligent solution integrates visualization, data 
analysis and monitoring to create a more efficient and secure production 
environment.
Piotr Wisniewski, PhD
499
Area 4B. Data storage methodology
This  assessment area focuses on how an organization manages its data, 
encompassing its collection, storage, organization and sharing processes. It 
involves understanding the types of data collected, their update frequency, and 
security needs. The selection of appropriate technologies such as databases, 
cloud solutions and storage networks is crucial, along with strategies for 
backup and archiving. The performance, availability and scalability of these 
systems must be defined to ensure that data are accessible and processed 
efficiently. Additionally, data reliability and security must be ensured to 
prevent loss and protect privacy. These considerations are critical in designing 
and implementing a robust data management system that delivers maximum 
organizational benefit.
Level 1. Traditional data storage methods. These rely on physically 
recording information on  paper. Data are printed and archived as hard copies 
in  offices or specialized archives. This approach is typical for smaller  firms 
lacking extensive IT systems and databases. A typical example  is a notary`s 
office, which stores the legal documents  of its clients as hard copies in binders 
and cabinets . When clients need access to their records, office staff must  
manually search through the paper archives, which can be time -consuming. 
In this case, paper-based storage is dictated by  legal requirements.
Level 2. Single local digital storage.  Information is held on a single device 
or workstation, which limits data access to that device only, meaning the 
information is not available to other users or systems. This approach is often 
employed in machine control systems, where data generated by the machine 
are stored on a local control device. An example would be a manufacturing 
plant where a machine control system for metal-cutting stores all its data on 
a local computer only. Engineers working in different parts of the factory 
cannot easily access these data, hindering the analysis and optimization of the 
production process. When there is a need to share this information with other 
employees or systems, data must be painstakingly copied manually.
Level 3. Dispersed local digital storage.  Various computers or devices are 
commonly used for data  storage in small businesses or by individual users. 
Digital Pathfinder
500  
Data are  saved on the hard drives of individual computers, resulting in  a lack 
of centralization in data storage. This approach carries  some risk related to 
data protection, as the failure or  loss of one computer can lead to the loss 
of  important information. Additionally, it complicates collaboration and 
data sharing among  employees and can be an obstacle to the analysis and  
utilization of data for business purposes. An example is a  small accounting 
firm where each employee stores client data on  their personal computer. If one 
of these computers fails or  is stolen, there is a risk of valuable data being  lost. 
Furthermore, the lack of a central database hinders effective  collaboration 
among employees, as they do not have easy access  to shared information.
Level 4. Local cloud storage.  A company  maintains and manages cloud 
infrastructure in its own data centre . This allows the organization to retain 
full control over its  data and ensure a high level of security, as access  to data 
is limited to authorized personnel. However, this method  requires significant 
investments in infrastructure and human resources for managing  and 
maintaining the local cloud. The example here is a  manufacturing company 
that uses its server space to store and  manage data related to quality control 
and safety. Although the  company has full control over its data and protects 
it  from unauthorized access, it bears the substantial costs of purchasing , 
maintaining and updating the infrastructure.
Level 5. Public cloud storage . This involves using the data-processing 
services of external cloud  service providers. These providers maintain cloud 
infrastructure, which their clients  access via the Internet. Public clouds offer 
a wide range  of services, including data processing, data storage, virtual 
machines and  tools for data analysis. A company that uses the services  of 
providers such as Google Cloud, Dropbox or AWS is  operating at this level. 
Employing a public cloud reduces costs , allows resources to be scaled, and 
provides flexibility in managing  data and applications.
Level 6. Private cloud storage.  Cloud infrastructure  is dedicated to a single 
organization. This means that cloud  resources such as servers, storage and 
network are available only  to the employees of that specific organization, and 
not to  external users. An example is a financial corporation such as  a bank  
Piotr Wisniewski, PhD
501
using a private cloud to securely store customer  data. This ensures full control 
over data security, a critical  aspect in the financial sector.
Level 7. Hybrid approaches.  Companies strategically manage their data 
storage by utilizing a mix of solutions tailored to the specific needs of different 
types of data. For instance, operational data critical for production processes 
are stored on edge devices for immediate access, while sensitive information 
like technical drawings is kept in private clouds to enhance security. Other 
data, such as financial and material reports, benefit from the scalability and 
accessibility of public clouds, allowing for resource adjustments in response 
to fluctuating demands. This approach not only optimizes performance and 
cost-efficiency but also ensures robust security and control, exemplified by an 
automotive component manufacturer who effectively segregates data storage 
based on function and sensitivity.

Area 4C. Data communication
A data communication system comprises methods and tools for transmitting 
information between different devices, applications and individuals. 
Fundamental components of the data communication system include 
communication protocols, computer networks, network devices, network 
management software and tools for monitoring and analysing network traffic.
Level 1. Hard-copy reporting.  Traditional paper reports are the primary 
means of communication and data transmission. This classic method involves 
printing data out and passing them between employees or sending them outside 
the company. An example might be a financial industry company still using 
traditional paper reports for internal and external communication. This is a 
costly and time-consuming approach with negative environmental impacts.
Level 2. Reporting via email.  This is a fast and convenient method of 
information transfer, facilitating easy document sharing among employees 
and ensuring easy access. However, it comes with data security risks, such 
as the possibility of data interception by unauthorized individuals or email 
system failures. It is thus essential to ensure adequate security measures, such 
as data encryption, confidentiality regulations and backup procedures. Let 
us take the example of a consulting company that relies on email to ensure 
the rapid transfer of essential reports and documents between its teams. The 
company, acutely aware of the security risks associated with data, implements 
advanced data encryption technologies and strictly adheres to confidentiality 
regulations.
Level 3. An Ethernet-based architecture.  This is one of the  most popular 
ways of building computer networks, allowing data transmission  between 
devices using an Ethernet cable. Ethernet-based architecture is  applied in 
Local Area Networks (LANs), which are known for  their high performance 
and operational reliability.
Level 4. An industrial  Ethernet-based architecture. This specialized 
network configuration is designed for industrial applications and has higher 
reliability, security and data transmission speed than traditional Ethernet 
networks. Industrial networks employ special network devices such as 
Piotr Wisniewski, PhD
503
switches, routers and gateways that are resistant to industrial conditions like 
vibrations, dust and humidity. Additionally, specific communication protocols 
like Modbus, Profibus and DeviceNet enable communication between various 
industrial devices.
Level 5. A wireless communication architecture.  Devices in this network 
connect to one another via a  central access point, facilitating centralized 
network management. Wireless networks find  applications in various 
industries, including manufacturing, transportation, medicine and services .
Level 6. A WAN/LAN architecture.  Here, devices like routers, switches and 
servers connect multiple computers and devices into a network. WAN/LAN 
networks provide a stable connection between company branches and offices, 
enabling access to data and applications from different devices and locations. 
Various protocols and technologies such as TCP/IP, VPN and MPLS ensure 
fast and secure data exchange within the organization. In particular, VPN 
(Virtual Private Network) technology ensures secure communication between 
locations, which is crucial for safeguarding sensitive company data.
Level 7. A cloud-based architecture. Applications, data and resources are 
stored and processed in the cloud, which is usually provided by an external 
vendor. A cloud-based architecture allows access to applications and data 
from anywhere and any Internet-enabled device, allowing resources to be 
scaled flexibly according to needs. This enables organizations to adapt more 
easily to changing business requirements and reduce the costs of maintaining 
infrastructure. An example of cloud-based architecture is a microservices 
architecture, where applications are built as a set of smaller, independent 
services that can be easily scaled and updated.

Area 4D. Big Data analysis
Big  Data analysis is a critical component of digital transformation, as it relates 
to leveraging vast datasets to extract valuable insights. This process employs 
advanced technologies and methodologies designed to efficiently analyse 
large volumes of data. By utilizing Big Data analysis tools, organizations can 
unlock profound insights into customer behaviour, emerging market trends, 
and intricate details of internal operations. These insights are pivotal in 
making informed decisions that can significantly enhance business strategies, 
operational efficiency and competitive advantage. Big Data analysis not only 
informs tactical moves but also supports strategic planning by providing a 
clearer picture of the market landscape and organizational performance.
Level 1. DBMSs. DataBase Management Systems facilitate effective data 
management by allowing large datasets to be created, stored, updated and 
analysed, giving them a crucial role in data collection and organization. 
DBMSs have applications in various fields, from business to science and 
engineering. MySQL, a popular solution in this category, is frequently used 
in web development, serving as an engine for storing and managing user data 
on products, transactions, and other elements that contribute to the smooth 
operation of websites and online applications.
Level 2. ETL systems.  Extract, Transform, Load systems perform a key 
process in data  management to enable the collection, processing and loading 
of information  from various sources into a single database. ETL systems allow  
efficient data acquisition from diverse sources such as databases, CSV  files, 
spreadsheets or XML files. Subsequently, these data are processed  to convert 
them to a consistent format and eliminate any  errors or inconsistencies. 
Finally, the data are loaded into the  target database, where they are ready for 
analysis and use .
Level 3. Tools for visualizing database information. Data are far better 
comprehended when presented in an effective graphical form. These tools 
enable users, including managers and business analysts, to quickly create 
various visualizations like charts, tables and heatmaps that improve our 
understanding of the information stored in databases. These visualizations 
Piotr Wisniewski, PhD
505
help users detect patterns, analyse trends and identify significant relationships 
in data. For instance, a marketing department manager may use a database 
visualization tool to create an interactive chart presenting the effectiveness 
of different advertising campaigns in various regions. This allows for a quick 
assessment of which campaign works best so that the marketing strategy can 
be adjusted.
Level 4. Tools for analysing large databases.  A crucial element in  Big Data 
analysis, these are advanced applications and platforms, such  as Apache, 
that enable the processing and analysis of massive  amounts of data in a 
distributed manner. This means that  data are processed on multiple servers 
simultaneously, ensuring scalability and  significant computing performance. 
An example might be an e-commerce  company employing Apache Spark 
to analyse vast sets of transactional  data. The tools help a company identify 
customer purchasing patterns , analyse trends and optimize marketing 
strategies. These tools provide a  deeper understanding of customer behaviour 
and better adaptation of the  product offering.
Level 5. Data quality management software.  Data quality can be checked, 
improved and maintained through the automated detection and elimination of 
data errors, standardization of data, verification of information from external 
sources, and completion of missing data. Often, these tools can manage the 
data entry and modification process, continuously monitor data quality and 
then generate data quality reports. For example, an insurance company might 
use such tools to automatically detect and correct errors in customer data.
Level 6. A data simulation methodology.  Data simulation is an incredibly 
useful tool in various fields and involves the creation of data that mimic real-
world information. This is particularly valuable for testing different scenarios 
and variations of system operations, algorithms or mathematical models. Data 
simulation can be used for safe, controlled testing without using real data, 
which is a crucial facility when dealing with sensitive information. In the 
medical field, for example, data simulation can create artificial datasets of 
patient information. The simulated data can be used to test and evaluate the 
performance of new diagnostic or therapeutic algorithms, eliminating the risk 
of making real-world errors or endangering patients.
Digital Pathfinder
506  
Level 7. Machine learning algorithms.  These powerful tools can identify  
and classify atypical data in ways that are often hard  or impossible using 
traditional analytical methods. The algorithms learn from  existing data in 
order to classify new data, making them  extremely versatile. In banks and 
payment processing companies, for example , machine learning algorithms can 
be used to identify anomalous customer  behaviours. By analysing extensive 
datasets, machine learning algorithms can detect  suspect behaviours and block 
such operations. Thus, by working with  a database of banking transactions, 
machine learning algorithms further protect customers against, for example, 
fraudulent activity.
Piotr Wisniewski, PhD
507
Area 4E. Computing
In  the realm of digital transformation, the area of computing focuses on 
the essential tasks of processing and analysing data within an organization. 
Utilizing a variety of modern technologies, data computing aims to 
dramatically enhance operational efficiency and effectiveness. By effectively 
harnessing these technological tools, organizations can extract and leverage 
valuable insights from their accumulated data. This not only aids in more 
informed decision-making but also optimizes business processes, thereby 
ensuring that the organization remains agile and responsive.
Level 1. Computation by PC.  Personal Computers are used for data -
processing tasks. These stations are equipped with efficient data-processing  
software and hardware. Data processing on PC stations is suited  to various 
fields, ranging from financial and marketing analysis to  CAD/CAM design. 
The drawback of this method is its  lack of scalability, meaning the amount 
of processed data is  limited by the computational power of the individual 
machine. In  the case of CAD/CAM design, PCs can be utilized  for 3D 
modelling and simulation, but with more complex projects  they may not meet 
the computational load requirements.
Level 2 . Computation by edge devices. Edge computing is an approach to 
data processing in which computational operations are executed on devices 
located near the data source, rather than in distant data-processing centres or 
the cloud. This approach allows for faster, more efficient, more effective data 
processing since data do not need to be transmitted to distant data centres, 
thereby reducing delays and network loads. Additionally, computations on 
edge devices improve decision-making speeds, as data are processed in 
real- time, even before being sent to data-processing centres or the cloud. 
For example, in medicine, computations on edge devices enable real-time 
monitoring of a patient`s condition, and crucial responses to changes can be 
made more quickly than if the data were to be transmitted to a remote centre 
for calculation.
Level 3. Virtual computing machines.  The virtualization  of computing 
machines is a technology that allows multiple virtual  machines to be run 
Digital Pathfinder
508  
on a single physical server or  computer. Each of these machines operates 
as a separate system , with its own hardware resources and software, and 
their operation  is isolated from other virtual machines and the host. Virtual  
computing machines in manufacturing companies, for instance, can speed 
up  simulations used to optimize production scheduling by performing them 
in  parallel, rather than in series. This enables near-real-time  adjustments to 
production plans in cases of disruptions to production  lines.
Level 4. GPU technology. Graphics Processing Units are a  type of processor 
specifically designed for graphics processing and parallel  computing. In recent 
years, they have become a popular tool  for accelerating computations in areas 
such as machine learning, data  analysis, numerical simulations and more. 
By leveraging hundreds or thousands  of parallel cores, GPUs can accelerate 
computations by several orders  of magnitude compared to traditional CPU 
processors.
Level 5. Cloud  computing. This is a model of delivering computational, 
networking and application services over the Internet. In cloud computing, 
computational resources such as servers, memory, networks and databases are 
provided as a service, allowing them to be used flexibly, based on user needs. 
Various service models are available in cloud computing, including Software-
as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service and Infrastructure-as-a-Service.
Level 6. HPC.  High-Performance Computing is a technology that can execute 
extraordinarily complex computations on multiple processors simultaneously. 
This allows large amounts of data to be processed quickly, which is essential 
in various fields such as science, finance, industry and data analysis. HPC 
systems consist of multiple computing nodes connected by a high-throughput 
network. In the field of science, HPC technology is used for simulating 
complex physical phenomena to process vast amounts of data and obtain 
results in a short time.
Level 7. Computer clusters.  These complex systems consist of many 
interconnected computers operating as a single computing unit. In the aviation  
industry, computer clusters are used for aerodynamics simulations, enabling 
the rapid processing of large amounts of data and shortening analysis times 
for more efficient designing of new aircraft models.

Axis 5: Competence levels and digital culture
Axis  5, focusing on the digital culture of an organization, describes softer, 
yet equally crucial aspects of a company`s digital transformation. Unlike 
the first three axes, which directly influence the financial performance of an 
organization, the last three, especially Axis 5, emphasize the organizational 
behaviours critical for successful transformation. Experience in implementing

A transformational culture within an organization encompasses values, 
attitudes and practices that promote agility in the face of changing market 
and technological conditions. Such a culture values openness to change, 
innovativeness and a propensity for experimentation and judicious risk-taking. 
In organizations endowed with a strong transformation culture, employees 
are actively engaged in the change process and encouraged by leaders to be 
creative and inventive, which enhances agility.
For  digital transformation strategies to succeed, they must align with the

meticulously developed digital strategies may encounter tepid support or 
outright resistance. Thus, it is imperative to cultivate an organizational 
culture that not only supports but champions the values integral to digital 
transformation. This axis will explore five key areas – leadership styles, 
readiness for change, continuous improvement, innovation culture and 
resource availability – each of which is crucial for fostering an environment 
conducive to sustainable digital growth.
Piotr Wisniewski, PhD
511
Area 5A. Leadership attitudes
In  the leadership aspect of digital transformation, we shift from evaluating 
on a ‘Level 1–6’ scale to using ‘Type 1–6’ to reflect that no single leadership 
attitude is inherently superior across all contexts. The aim is to discern 
predominant leadership traits within the organization and identify those 
that should be cultivated to promote readiness for transformation. This 
evaluation helps pinpoint the most visible leadership characteristics in the 
current organizational climate and identify potential areas for development. 
By understanding these dynamics, organizations can intentionally sculpt 
their leadership culture to align with modern demands and transformational 
challenges. Six types of leadership attitudes – passive, autocratic, directive, 
supportive, innovator and transformative – are assessed. The crucial task is to 
determine which are the prevalent attitudes and which should be developed to 
prepare the organization for successful transformation.
Type 1. Passive leadership  is characterized by the leader`s lack of active 
engagement in innovative processes and failure to motivate employees. A 
leader adopting this attitude leaves employees without help and support. The 
organization may experience stagnation as a result, and the lack of innovation 
and creativity in the company degrades competitiveness. A typical example of 
this attitude would be a leader who takes no action related to innovation and 
does not motivate employees to think creatively. Feeling abandoned and with 
their ideas for improvement ignored or trivialized, the employees who might 
drive change lose enthusiasm. Ultimately, market position is lost because 
competitors investing in innovation gain a competitive advantage.
Type 2. Autocratic leadership  is an approach in which the leader makes 
decisions independently, without involving the team. It is characterized by 
a tendency to ignore suggestions and ideas from employees, significantly 
hindering innovation in the organization. Not being consulted, the team feels 
excluded from the decision- making process, and their contributions are not 
appreciated. As a result, innovation and creativity in the company are limited, 
degrading the organization`s capacity to generate new ideas and to develop.
Digital Pathfinder
512  
Type 3. Directive leadership  focuses on guiding the team to achieve 
specific goals and results related to innovation. The leader is demanding 
and organized but can provide the team with the necessary resources and 
tools to help them achieve these goals. As an example of this attitude, we 
can cite Steve Jobs, the former CEO of Apple. Jobs was known for setting 
exceedingly high expectations for his team, especially regarding innovation 
and product quality. However, he also provided his team with the necessary 
tools and resources, such as technological innovations and financial support, 
contributing to the creation of innovative products. This leadership attitude 
can result in achieving ambitious innovation goals while maintaining control 
over the process. 50
Type 4. Supportive leadership  is based on supporting and motivating 
employees to create new ideas and innovations. Such a leader creates a 
work environment in which people feel safe sharing ideas and taking risks. 
This attitude strongly encourages team members to think creatively and 
take initiative. A leader with a supportive attitude creates an atmosphere of 
trust in which employees feel that their ideas are valued. This, in turn, can 
contribute to the development of creativity and innovation in the organization 
because people are more willing to share ideas and experiment. An example 
of this attitude is Richard Branson, the founder of the Virgin Group. Branson 
is known for creating an organizational culture based on support and for 
motivating employees to innovate. Thanks to this approach, his company has 
become a source of numerous new products and services. 51
Type 5. Innovator leadership  constantly seeks new opportunities and 
ideas; it experiments and strives for innovation. Such a leader is open to 
risk and mistakes, as well as to feedback and suggestions from the team. 
The innovator continually seeks inspiration for further development, both in 
terms of operating methods and market offerings. This attitude is embodied 
by Elon Musk, the driving force behind companies such as SpaceX and Tesla. 
Musk is known for his willingness to take risks and invest in innovative 
projects. His approach inspires teams to think outside the box and strive for 
continuous development. For a leader with an innovator attitude, it is essential 
to encourage experimentation and not be afraid to make changes. 52
Piotr Wisniewski, PhD
513
Type 6. Transformative leadership is a style in which the leader aims to bring 
about changes and transformation in the organization. Such a leader focuses on 
building vision and motivation to inspire others to act. At the same time, there 
is an emphasis on values, ethics and morality and the continuous development 
of employees. The main differentiator of this attitude is a rejection of the status 
quo and a continuous pursuit of improvement and change. Warren Buffett, 
the renowned investor and founder of Berkshire Hathaway, is an example 
of a transformative leader in the world of finance. His investment strategy, 
based on long-term thinking and ethical principles, changed how investors 
perceive the financial market. Buffett always emphasized the importance 
of honesty and continuous learning. This approach contributed not only to 
the success of his company but also to shaping ethical standards throughout 
the financial industry. Thus, a leader with a transformative attitude can bring 
about significant changes in the organization, especially in companies needing 
cultural revolution, innovation and a long-term strategy. Their ability to 
inspire others and consistently set and pursue goals contributes to the success 
of both the organization and its employees. 53

514  
Area 5B. Readiness for change
This  area assesses how prepared a company is to implement and adapt to 
new digital strategies and innovations. This evaluation focuses on the 
organization`s agility and responsiveness to technological shifts and market 
demands. It gauges whether the workforce and leadership are predisposed to 
embrace transformation initiatives or to resist them due to entrenched habits 
or a fear of the unknown. The need for change must be recognized if any 
transition to new processes and technologies is to run smoothly.
Level 1. Recognizing the need for change.  Organizations aiming for  success 
and competitiveness must identify the need for change and  take action to 
implement it. It is essential to understand  why change is necessary, what 
might happen if it is  not implemented, and what benefits might arise from 
new solutions . Implementing change can be challenging and may require 
sacrifices, but  organizations that embrace the challenge and actively strive for 
improvement  have a better chance of surviving and developing. As a  negative 
example, Kodak, by failing to recognize the need for  change and adaptation to 
the digital revolution in photography, lost  its dominant market position.
Level 2. A coalition dedicated to  implementing transformation. A group 
of individuals or a team work together to achieve a specific transformative 
goal. In the context of organizational transformation, a coalition may consist 
of employees, managers, project leaders and other individuals with a stake in 
the changes. The team`s goals are to support and promote changes, to engage 
employees and encourage them to engage fully in the transformation, and to 
overcome resistance to change while also addressing conflicts. A coalition 
can also assist in identifying and resolving problems that may arise during the 
transformation process.
Level 3. Seeking a vision. Formulating a vision and  strategy for digital 
transformation is a crucial part of the  process. The vision should determine 
the direction in which the  organization wants to go, and the strategy 
should describe the  action plan and specific goals to be achieved by the  
transformation. Practice shows how important it is to involve all  employees 
in creating the vision and change strategy and in  implementing them. An 
Piotr Wisniewski, PhD
515
example of this level of excellence is  a company in which employees from 
various departments are involved  in creating the vision of change, identifying 
key challenges and  developing a strategy, thereby enhancing the sense of 
ownership and  commitment to the transformation plan.
Level 4. Communicating the vision . The vision of change must be formulated 
and presented in a way that is accessible to all employees. Communication 
should be two-way and consider the opinions and suggestions of employees 
so that the vision can be better adapted to the organization`s actual needs. 
Continuous communication of progress and achievements is also crucial for 
maintaining motivation and engagement in the change process.
Level 5. Implementing change. Implementing change  initiatives involves 
taking specific actions to introduce and carry out  changes. Implementing 
changes requires that we plan, define goals and  directions, and identify the 
people and resources needed for change . It is also essential to define criteria 
for assessing progress  and results.
Level 6. Institutionalizing and inculturating change.  At this stage, the 
objective is to make the transformation integral to the company`s working 
methods and culture. It is important to regularly assess the effectiveness of 
implemented changes and modify the strategy accordingly. Also important 
is that adequate training and support be given to help employees adapt to 
the new priorities and ways of working. This requires that the leadership 
continuously engage in the transformation process and promote the newly 
implemented solutions.
Digital Pathfinder
516  
Area 5C. Continuous professional development
This  area emphasizes the ongoing education and skill enhancement of 
employees within an organization. This facet of digital transformation is 
essential for maintaining a workforce that is not only proficient with current 
technologies but also adaptable to future innovations. By prioritizing continuous 
learning, organizations can ensure that their teams remain competitive and are 
well-prepared to cope with new difficulties and technologies as they arise. 
This area assesses the effectiveness of training programmes, the accessibility 
of learning resources and the overall commitment of the organization to 
fostering an environment of lifelong learning and professional growth.
Level 1. Outside contact. Trade fairs and conferences are popular venues for 
developing skills within the organization. At such industry events, company 
representatives and specialists meet to share knowledge and experience, learn 
about the latest trends and technologies, and establish business contacts. 
Conferences, in turn, allow experts to share their knowledge and experience in 
a specific field. Lectures panel discussions and workshops engage employees 
in developing skills and acquiring new competencies. Conferences also 
provide an excellent opportunity for business networking and exchanging 
experiences with other specialists in the industry.
Level 2. Internal training. The training system within an organization 
plays a crucial role in transforming its culture, requiring employees to stay 
updated with the latest trends and technologies through regular training that 
enhances both technical and soft skills such as communication and leadership. 
This system should be adaptable to different learning styles and tailored to 
employee needs, fostering an environment that values continuous learning 
and improvement. Moreover, internal training – whether conducted by in-
house specialists or external experts – focuses on enhancing skills, developing 
potential and increasing knowledge, indicating the company`s commitment 
to employee development and integrating training into its cultural fabric.
Level 3. External training.  Training provided by external companies brings 
in seasoned specialists  who offer fresh perspectives and diverse problem-
solving techniques, enhancing  the organizational transformation process by 
Piotr Wisniewski, PhD
517
integrating an external view on  necessary changes. While external training 
exposes employees to a broader  range of experts and knowledge, potentially 
breaking organizational insularity, it  may not always align perfectly with 
the immediate needs of  the company. In contrast, internal training is more 
adaptable to  specific organizational contexts but might simply circulate pre-
existing knowledge  within the company. This suggests a strategic blend of 
both  internal and external training could optimize learning outcomes and 
adaptation  to change.
Level 4. Self-development. Self-education is a  continual process of individual 
acquisition of knowledge, skills and experience  without the need for formal 
education, such as through reading  books and articles or participating in 
online training. Self-education  allows individuals to develop in directions 
that most interest them  in the way that best suits them. In the context  of 
organizations, employees` self-education can, and should, be integrated  into 
the transformation culture strategy.
Level 5. Working in project  teams.  Project teams consist of employees 
from various departments who collaborate on specific tasks or projects, 
leveraging their expertise towards a common objective. This team structure 
not only speeds up decision-making and boosts efficiency but also facilitates 
personal skill development and broader professional growth through cross-
functional collaboration. For instance, when developing a new product or 
service, representatives from different departments can pool their specialized 
knowledge, enhancing the entire team`s understanding of the project`s 
challenges and potential solutions. This approach not only achieves better 
outcomes but also serves as a powerful educational experience within the 
context of real-world tasks.
Level 6. Mentoring. In this model , an experienced employee, the mentor, 
serves as a guide and  support for a junior employee, the mentee. Mentors 
are carefully  selected for their rich experience and competence in a specific  
field, with their main goals being to assist the mentee  in understanding the 
demands of their job and tools and  to guide them towards achieving their 
goals. Mentoring is often  integrated into organizational training programmes 
but can also exist as  an individual professional development programme for 
Digital Pathfinder
518  
employees. Through regular meetings , mentors share their knowledge and 
experience, help mentees develop practical  skills, and provide advice on key 
issues related to their  career paths. This process, based on a relationship of 
mutual  trust, often significantly expands the mentee`s competencies, boosting 
their achievements within the organization.
Piotr Wisniewski, PhD
519
Area 5D. Culture of innovation
The  ‘Culture of Innovation’ area focuses on fostering a workplace environment 
where creativity and novel ideas are not just welcomed but actively 
encouraged. In such organizations, employees are motivated to explore 
new solutions and innovative approaches, contributing to the organization` s 
continuous development. A strong innovation culture views mistakes as 
learning opportunities rather than setbacks, promoting a mindset of growth 
and resilience. This initiative-taking stance is crucial for maintaining agility 
and effectiveness in a rapidly evolving market, allowing the organization to 
capitalize on emerging opportunities and drive sustainable success.
Level 1. Promotion of new ideas.  At this stage, organizations  encourage their 
employees to engage in generating innovative ideas. This  is the moment when 
creativity is nurtured. This level is  achieved by organizations that regularly 
organize hackathons and create dedicated  platforms for employees to share 
their ideas. Furthermore, the most  innovative proposals are acknowledged by 
rewarding employees.
Level 2. Experimentation . Organizations allow their employees to test 
new concepts and ideas in practice. Employees are given the opportunity to 
implement their ideas, which is a significant step in the process of creating 
innovation. At this stage, support mechanisms exist for experimental 
projects, but they are not fully developed. Organizations approach this 
process cautiously, encouraging employees to conduct research projects 
and prototyping. This approach minimizes the risk and costs of changes and 
allows for effective testing of ideas in real conditions.
Level 3. Active market trend analysis. This stage involves not  only identifying 
trends but also seeking to understand their implications  for the company`s 
operations. Organizations examine changes in customer  preferences, market 
competition and innovations in their industry. This in -depth analysis enables 
organizations to better understand their environment and  adjust their strategy. 
So, for example, a cosmetics company might  use a detailed analysis of market 
trends to identify growing  consumer interest in environmentally friendly 
products. Instead of remaining passive  to these changes, the company 
Digital Pathfinder
520  
adjusts its offerings by introducing  eco-friendly products, thus acquiring new 
customers and strengthening its  market position.
Level 4. Acceptance of mistakes. Organizations at this stage understand that 
experimentation and seeking new solutions can sometimes lead to errors, but 
they are willing to accept this risk. Employees feel free to take risks and explore 
new ideas, even if it involves the chance of mistakes. Some companies, for 
example, run regular competitions for the biggest blunder of the week. As part 
of the competition, employees are encouraged to share mistakes that happened 
during the week. Though unusual, the contest aims to emphasize that every 
employee can make mistakes and that the company can accept mistakes as 
long as they lead to learning and improvement. This innovative approach 
to accepting mistakes aims to eliminate the fear of making mistakes and to 
create an atmosphere of experimentation. Employees, seeing that mistakes 
are part of the development and learning process, gain more confidence and 
willingness to try new solutions. This makes the organization more flexible 
and innovative.
Level 5. R&D integration into company strategy.  Organizations at this  
stage invest significant resources in research, develop experimental activities, 
and  design new solutions that are later tested in the form  of prototypes. The 
R&D process is no longer a  one-time event but a constant part of the pursuit  
of innovation within the organization. Employees recognize the role of  this 
process in creating new products or services and strengthening  the company`s 
market position.
Level 6. Integration of external  collaboration into company strategy. 
Organizations acknowledge that partnerships with other  companies, research 
institutes or startups are crucial for accelerating the  innovation process. 
By being open to collaboration with external entities , organizations gain 
access to new technologies, knowledge and perspectives that  may be hard to 
obtain internally. This approach allows organizations  to better leverage the 
innovation ecosystem and more quickly put  out new solutions. An example 
here is a medical software  company that partnered with a local university. They 
jointly researched  advanced diagnostic tools. This collaboration provided the 
company access to  the latest scientific and technological advancements and 
Piotr Wisniewski, PhD
521
expert knowledge from  the university. This resulted in the faster introduction 
of advanced  diagnostic tools to the market, benefiting both the company and 
the entire medical sector.

Area 5E. Resource availability
Resource  availability is pivotal in assessing an organization`s capacity to 
support and sustain transformational efforts. It involves securing not only the 
financial investments necessary for initiating change but also ensuring access 
to the appropriate tools, software and equipment that empower employees 
to execute and maintain new solutions. Additionally, employees must have 
sufficient time and be given the right opportunities to contribute meaningfully 
to these changes. Effective resource allocation directly influences the pace and 
success of innovation, enabling organizations to adapt swiftly and efficiently to 
new threats and opportunities in the digital landscape. This strategic approach 
to resource management fosters an environment where transformation can 
thrive, supported by a robust infrastructure of both material and human assets.
Level 1. Access to capital.  Organizations direct their attention to ensuring 
adequate sources of funding for the transformation process. This is a key 
element of organizational transformation, as organizations must be prepared to 
finance planned initiatives and projects. The question is whether the company 
has a financial plan that includes expenses for implementing transformation 
initiatives.
Level 2. Access to training. The question here  is whether various paths to 
training exist within the organization , including both internal and external 
training, mentoring programmes and self -learning. The example here is of a 
manufacturing company that  was introducing a new management system. The 
company expanded its  training programmes to cover various aspects of the 
new system . Employees were given access to internal training on operating 
the  new software but also participated in webinars conducted by the  system 
provider, allowing them to gain firsthand expert knowledge.
Level  3. Access to experts.  The focus is on whether employees  consistently 
access expert knowledge through both external consultations and internal  
training. This approach evaluates whether an organization is committed to  
ongoing employee development and effectively integrates expert knowledge 
into its  t r a n s f o r m a t i o n  s t r a t e g y .  F o r  i n s t a n c e ,  a  m a r k e t i n g  a g e n c y  h a s  
established a  continuous relationship with an SEO expert who not only 
Piotr Wisniewski, PhD
523
conducts  workshops but also provides ongoing support, enhancing the team`s  
skills and the agency`s processes. This sustained engagement with  specialists 
not only boosts employee capabilities but also significantly enhances  the 
agency`s marketing success, thereby increasing customer satisfaction and  
competitive edge. This exemplifies an organization`s strategic use of  experts 
as a core component of its innovative culture.
Level  4. Access to data.  Organizations move from basic data analysis 
to advanced use of data in the decision-making process. The question is 
whether the organization has appropriate information systems and databases 
and focuses on securing and utilizing them. At this point, the organization 
realizes that data are an essential foundation for fact-based decision-making. 
An example could be a logistics company utilizing advanced IT tools for 
shipment analysis. Through a data warehouse, the company can precisely 
monitor, analyse and forecast shipment traffic. Decisions such as optimizing 
delivery routes or inventory management are data-driven rather than intuitive. 
Furthermore, the company emphasizes data security, which is crucial when 
dealing with shipment information.
Level 5. Access to technology.  Organizations  concentrate on providing 
employees with access to modern tools and  technologies. The question 
of whether employees have access to modern  technologies supported by 
appropriate training and technical assistance is crucial  in the context of 
organizational transformation. Organizations realize that innovations  often 
require tools that allow for more advanced actions, and  they invest in them. 
Our example here is that of  an advertising agency deciding to invest in the 
latest graphic  design and data analysis software. This gives employees access 
to  advanced tools to create effective advertising campaigns and analyse 
their  outcomes. Furthermore, the company secures training for employees, 
enabling them  to use the new technologies effectively. This is an example  
of an organization that understands that investments in modern technologies  
contribute to improving efficiency and competitiveness.
Level 6. Access to  partners.  Organizations pay special attention to the 
ability to collaborate with external entities. This collaboration is crucial in the 
context of organizational transformation because external partners can bring 
Digital Pathfinder
524  
knowledge, experience and capital that expedite innovative processes. The 
example here is a software company and a technical university entering into 
a strategic partnership. The university provides the company with research 
and knowledge in technology, and, in return, the company offers internships 
to university students. This mutual benefit accelerates the innovation process 
and contributes to the development of both parties. For the university, it means 
that its knowledge finds practical application and that it can provide students 
access to real projects. For the software company, it means access to the latest 
research and young, talented employees.

Axis 6: Cybersecurity
In  the digital age, cybersecurity has transcended its past role as a mere 
safeguard to become a fundamental pillar of operational integrity and trust. 
As organizations increasingly digitalize their operations, the importance of 
robust cybersecurity measures has never been more critical. Accordingly, 
this sixth axis of digital transformation explores how deeply an organization 
has ingrained security practices into its digital and operational fabric. 
The relentless evolution of cyber threats means that a proactive stance on 
cybersecurity is not just advisable; it is imperative for protecting sensitive 
customer data, ensuring privacy and maintaining the trust that is so crucial to

integrity. As we elaborate on the specifics of each area, we underscore the 
critical need for an integrated approach to cybersecurity, one that stays in step 
with both technological advancements and emerging threats. The level of an 
organization`s digital development in the area of cybersecurity is assessed in 
five areas: strategy and risk management, network and system protection, data 
protection, education and quality systems, and emergency plans. Each area is 
evaluated on a scale from level one to level six.
Piotr Wisniewski, PhD
527
Area 6A. Strategy and risk management
Strategy  and risk management emphasizes the foundational need for a coherent 
and comprehensive approach to security within an organization. This entails 
the establishment and enforcement of a robust cybersecurity strategy and 
policy that outlines the organization`s security objectives, principles, standards 
and procedures. They also delineate the roles and responsibilities associated 
with managing and mitigating risks. This strategic framework is crucial for 
identifying potential cybersecurity risks. Through systematic analysis and 
assessment, the organization can prioritize these risks and apply the most 
effective risk management techniques to minimize exposure and enhance its 
defence against potential security breaches. This strategic preparation is vital 
for building a resilient infrastructure that can withstand and rapidly recover 
from disruptions caused by cyber threats.
Level 1. No cybersecurity strategy or policy.  The organization has not 
developed  or implemented a cybersecurity strategy or policy. There are 
no  defined goals, standards or security procedures. Risk management is 
impossible , and the organization is exposed to serious threats.
Level 2 . Risk analysis. The strategy involves a cybersecurity risk analysis 
that determines threats and risks associated with the organization`s activities, 
the assets exposed to risk (such as customer data) and the development of 
preventive measures. For example, in a financial institution, risk analysis may 
include assessing threats to payment systems, identifying vulnerable assets 
such as customer data, and developing preventive measures.
Level 3. Action plan. The strategy includes, in  addition to risk analysis, 
an action plan that specifies the  precise steps the organization will take to 
minimize risk. In  a bank, the action plan may include regular software updates , 
security training and the implementation of incident response procedures.
Level  4. Security policies.  The strategy also describes cybersecurity policies 
that define the standards and procedures the organization will use to protect its 
assets and data. In a company, security policies may include rules for setting 
strong passwords, data and system access procedures, and guidelines for 
software updates.
Digital Pathfinder
528  
Level 5. Strategy includes human resource management.  This may 
cover training the  organization`s staff in the skills and knowledge needed to  
effectively counter cybersecurity threats. For example, the company includes 
regular  security training for employees and specialized courses for the IT  
team, increasing readiness to respond to cybersecurity threats.
Level 6 . Monitoring and assessment. The strategy includes plans for 
monitoring and assessing the effectiveness of cybersecurity actions to ensure 
that the strategy is working and being updated as the organization` s needs 
change. Examples of solutions include regular audits, penetration tests and 
log analysis to monitor and adjust the cybersecurity strategy to current needs.
Piotr Wisniewski, PhD
529
Area 6B. Protection of networks and systems
The  protection of networks and systems focuses on the deployment of robust 
technologies and methodologies essential for safeguarding an organization` s 
digital infrastructure. This includes the installation of firewalls, intrusion 
detection systems and antivirus software, which serve as the first line of 
defence against cyber threats. Additionally, implementing access control 
systems ensures that sensitive information and critical systems are accessible 
only to authorized personnel. Data encryption and routine backups further 
fortify security by protecting data integrity and ensuring that, even in the 
event of a breach or data loss, the organization can recover swiftly and 
effectively. These protective measures are integral to maintaining the security 
and operational continuity of the network and system infrastructure.
Level 1. Firewalls. This type of  software or device acts as a barrier controlling 
traffic between  different segments of the network, allowing only trusted 
sources to  access sensitive financial data. This ensures effective protection 
against potential  threats. For example, for companies in the financial industry, 
such  as banks or investment firms, a firewall is a key  tool for protecting 
against unauthorized access to networks. 
Level 2 . Antivirus.  Companies install antivirus programs on all their 
computers to regularly scan files and systems, detecting and removing 
malicious software. This is crucial for, for example, maintaining the security 
of medical information and system stability. In the healthcare sector, where 
patient data confidentiality is a priority, antivirus programs serve as the first 
line of defence against malicious software.
Level 3. Intrusion Detection Systems.  In case of suspicious activities, such  
as intrusion attempts or attacks on control systems, these systems  immediately 
generate alarms, allowing for a quick response and risk  minimization. For 
example, in the energy sector, threat detection systems  are essential for 
monitoring network traffic and securing energy infrastructure . 
Level 4. SIEM or IDS.  Upon detecting abnormalities in  delivery or attempts 
to compromise data, Security Information and Event  Management systems 
and Intrusion Detection Systems analyse data from multiple  sources and 
Digital Pathfinder
530  
generate alerts or reports, enabling an effective response  and ensuring 
operational continuity. These systems are used in the  transportation sector, for 
example. Here, where complex logistics networks and  data management are 
commonplace, incident detection systems are essential. 
Level  5. Authorization and Authentication Systems. These systems verify 
the user`s identity and access level. In the education sector, for example, 
where there is a need to secure access to university resources, authorization 
and authentication systems are indispensable. Students and staff must provide 
unique identification data and passwords to access educational materials. 
Level 6. VPN.  Virtual Private Networks are  used as a fundamental part 
of cybersecurity in, for example , the e-commerce industry, where secure 
transmission of financial data  is a priority. Online merchants use VPNs to 
ensure a  secure connection between different geographical locations, protecting 
sensitive data from  interception. This allows for the secure transmission of 
financial information over public networks while protecting customers.
Piotr Wisniewski, PhD
531
Area 6C. Data security
This  area evaluates the stringent measures an organization employs to protect 
sensitive data from unauthorized access and breaches. It emphasizes strictly 
limiting data access to authorized personnel based on predefined roles and 
permissions, thereby mitigating the risks associated with internal threats 
or inadvertent data exposures. Furthermore, this area assesses the methods 
used to safeguard data during transmission and storage, which include robust 
encryption techniques and rigorous authorization protocols. Adherence to data 
minimization principles – collecting and processing only the data absolutely 
necessary for specific purposes – further enhances the security posture, 
ensuring compliance with regulatory standards and reducing the likelihood of 
data vulnerabilities.
Level 1. Data encryption. This involves using cryptographic algorithms 
to secure data from unauthorized access and reading. This requires that 
encryption algorithms be implemented, monitored and updated and that 
employees be trained in the correct use of encryption tools.
Level 2. Password security. This involves enforcing the use, regular  
changing and secure storage of strong passwords. This requires implementing  
a password security and storage management policy – for example, in  
encrypted form.
Level 3. Access controls. Access to data is limited to authorized users 
only based on roles and permission levels. This involves defining roles 
and permission levels for users, implementing access monitoring and audit 
systems and training employees in adhering to principles of access control.
Level 4. BDR. Backup and Disaster Recovery involves regularly creating 
backup copies of data so that, in the event of the loss of original data, they can 
be effectively restored. This requires that a backup strategy be established, 
that the process of data restoration from backup copies be tested, and that the 
backup strategy be regularly adjusted to changing needs.
Level 5. Monitoring and threat detection. Tools are used that monitor 
networks and  s y s t e m s  t o  d e t e c t  a b n o r m a l i t i e s  a n d  t h r e a t s .  T h i s  i n v o l v e s  
Digital Pathfinder
532  
implementing solutions  that monitor systems and network traffic, training 
monitoring personnel to  respond to security alarms and continually updating 
monitoring tools.
Level  6 .  I d e n t i t y  v e r i f i c a t i o n  a n d  a u t h e n t i c a t i o n . Preventing unauthorized 
access to data and systems by unauthorized individuals requires the 
implementation of identity verification systems, such as biometric scanners 
or digital certificates, and, of course, training.
Piotr Wisniewski, PhD
533
Area 6D. Education and training
This  area highlights the importance of continuous learning to enhance 
employee awareness and capabilities in countering cybersecurity threats. 
Training starts with fundamental cybersecurity hygiene – creating strong 
passwords, identifying suspicious links and reporting anomalies – and 
progresses to cover more sophisticated threats like advanced phishing, social 
engineering and ransomware. Regular simulations and knowledge tests assess 
training effectiveness and identify areas needing improvement, thereby 
ensuring that training evolves to keep pace with cybercriminal tactics. This 
ongoing education is critical, making employees proactive defenders and an 
essential part of an organization`s cybersecurity strategy, to build a resilient, 
aware workforce capable of minimizing security incidents.
Level 1. Description of a cybersecurity training system. This  system is 
used to plan, organize and conduct cybersecurity training  in the organization. 
The description sets precise training goals, schedules  and topics to be covered, 
and it identifies appropriate trainers . In large enterprises, such a system helps 
identify training needs .
Level 2. Implementation plan for cybersecurity training.  This plan is 
crucial for increasing employee awareness of threats and ways to minimize 
them. It includes various forms of training, from traditional face-to-face 
sessions to online courses and attack simulations. It is also important to 
determine indicators for monitoring training progress and to adjust the plan 
accordingly.
Level 3. Security testing system.  This tool identifies weaknesses in the 
IT  system, allowing them to be fixed before attackers can exploit  them. 
Implementation and regular security testing help minimize the risk  of 
cyberattacks.
Level 4. Internal auditors.  Employees are trained as internal auditors who 
conduct regular internal audits of cybersecurity. Their goal is to assess the 
effectiveness of systems and procedures, contributing to continuous 
improvement in this area.
Digital Pathfinder
534  
Level 5. Cybersecurity audit plan.  This schedules and determines the scope 
of  internal and external audits to assess effectiveness and compliance with  
the organization`s cybersecurity policies and procedures. It also ensures  
compliance with applicable standards and regulations on information security.
Level  6. ISO 27001.  This international standard for information security 
management is used to certify organizations that have implemented a 
sufficient information security management system. Certification attests to 
high-quality risk management and protection of confidential information in 
the organization. This certificate builds trust with customers and business 
partners and contributes to the company`s development.
Piotr Wisniewski, PhD
535
Area 6E. Emergency planning
Emergency  planning in cybersecurity involves developing detailed strategies 
for swift and effective response to cyber incidents. This comprehensive 
approach includes regular risk assessments, audits and the identification of 
critical areas to establish clear action priorities during emergencies. Effective 
emergency plans ensure rapid response capabilities that minimize operational 
disruptions and losses by quickly restoring critical system functions. Moreover, 
this plan encompasses ongoing employee training, regular testing of response 
procedures and meticulous maintenance of documentation to ensure readiness 
and compliance with standards. As an integral part of a cybersecurity strategy, 
emergency planning not only helps in effectively managing incidents but 
also reinforces organizational trust by demonstrating to its stakeholders 
and customers the company`s degree of preparedness, thereby safeguarding 
business continuity and reducing risk exposure.
Level 1. Threat identification. The first step  in developing emergency plans 
is to identify potential threats to  the organization`s information systems and 
data. A security audit  and risk analysis are conducted to determine areas 
requiring special  protection.
Level 2. Defining priorities.  The next stage is determining priorities in the 
event of an incident. The emergency plan must precisely define which parts 
of the system require immediate repair and restoration.
Level 3. Defining procedures.  The emergency  plan should contain detailed 
procedures for handling incidents. These procedures  describe specific steps to 
be taken to limit the effects  of an attack or a failure of information systems.
Level  4. Regular employee training.  Another element of developing 
emergency plans is regular employee training in emergencies. These training 
sessions cover both technical aspects and security procedures.
Level 5. Testing emergency plans.  After defining emergency plans, it 
is important to  regularly test them in practice. These tests should include 
various  incident scenarios and be conducted in a controlled manner. Regular   
Digital Pathfinder
536  
testing allows adjustments to be made to emergency plans based  on changing 
conditions and threats.
Level 6. Documentation. To ensure  the effectiveness of emergency plans, it 
is necessary to keep  accurate documentation. This documentation includes 
information about procedures, test results  and implemented changes. 
This allows for the rapid identification of  weaknesses and introduction 
of corrections. Precise documentation is important if  incidents are to be 
responded to swiftly and their harms  minimized.
In conclusion, cybersecurity is often underappreciated until a crisis  unfolds. 
Much like safety measures in traditional industries, where the  value of a Safety 
Officer is often only recognized following  a serious incident, the critical 
importance of robust cybersecurity measures  tends to be realized in hindsight. 
As enterprises expand their  digital footprints, the necessity for both technical 
and non-technical  measures to safeguard information, systems, and software 
becomes increasingly imperative . This aspect of digital transformation is not 
merely a precaution ; it is an essential component of maintaining trust and 
operational  integrity in the digital age. Neglecting this could lead to  severe 
consequences, making it essential for businesses to prioritize and continuously 
enhance their cybersecurity strategies.

AXIS 7: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE READINESS & INTEGRATION (Wprowadzenie do całej osi – styl zgodny z pozostałymi osiami DRD) Artificial Intelligence has become one of the most transformative forces shaping modern organizations. While earlier axes examine processes, data, culture or products, this axis focuses on the organization’s ability to adopt, scale and operationalize AI in a structured, safe and value-creating manner. AI is no longer an experimental technology reserved for innovators. It increasingly defines competitive advantage, productivity, decision-making quality and the speed at which organizations can respond to change. Companies that understand how to integrate AI into their architecture, processes, people and governance structures will build stronger adaptability and long-term resilience. Axis 7 evaluates maturity across five areas that collectively determine the organization’s readiness for AI: 7A – Data Exposure & AI Foundations Evaluates how accessible, structured and prepared the organization’s data is for use by AI models. 7B – AI-Augmented Processes Describes how deeply AI supports or automates decision-making inside operational and administrative workflows. 7C – AI in Products & Services Assesses whether AI enhances offerings or becomes a core component of new digital products. 7D – AI Governance, Safety & Ethics Measures the organization’s capability to manage risks, compliance and responsible AI deployment. 7E – AI Empowerment of Employees Examines whether employees possess the skills, tools and routines to work effectively with AI in daily operations. 
The maturity scale, similarly to other axes, ranges from Level 1 (initial) to Level 5 (advanced) and allows organizations to identify precisely where they stand and what steps must be taken to progress to the next stage.  AREA 7A — Data Exposure & AI Foundations Wprowadzenie (dlaczego to ważne) Artificial Intelligence is only as powerful as the data it can access. Organizations with fragmented, inconsistent or inaccessible data struggle to achieve meaningful AI outcomes. Conversely, companies that maintain structured, integrated and governed data environments progress quickly toward automation, advanced analytics and generative AI adoption. This area assesses whether the organization’s data architecture — including operational data, transactional data, machine data, documents and knowledge — is ready to be consumed by AI models. A company cannot achieve AI maturity without achieving maturity in this area first. Poniżej przedstawiono pięciopoziomową skalę umożliwiającą precyzyjną samoocenę.  LEVEL 1 — Fragmented Data, No AI Readiness Jak to rozumieć Data are scattered across spreadsheets, local drives and disconnected systems. There is no unified view of the organization’s information. Preparing any dataset for analysis requires manual work and significant effort. Data quality issues are common and not monitored. Typowe technologie / brak technologii • Excel, lokalne pliki, brak API • Brak systemów ETL / brak hurtowni danych • Brak standardów nazewnictwa i metadanych Jak rozpoznać, że jesteś na tym poziomie 
• Każde zapytanie analityczne wymaga ręcznego zbierania danych • Dane są niekompletne lub niespójne między systemami • AI nie może działać, bo dane nie są dostępne w odpowiednim formacie  LEVEL 2 — Structured Data in Silos Jak to rozumieć Firma posiada kilka systemów cyfrowych (ERP, MES, CRM), ale każdy z nich przechowuje dane we własnym „silosie”. Dane są bardziej uporządkowane, lecz nie są łatwo dostępne dla AI. Eksporty realizowane są ręcznie. Typowe technologie • ERP / MES / CRM jako główne źródła danych • Podstawowe API, ale niewykorzystywane • Manualne integracje (CSV, XLS export/import) Jak rozpoznać, że jesteś na tym poziomie • Dane są cyfrowe, lecz niepołączone • Aby wykonać analizę, pracownicy łączą pliki z różnych źródeł • AI może działać tylko na małych, jednorazowo przygotowanych zestawach  LEVEL 3 — Centralized Data & Initial AI Readiness Jak to rozumieć Organizacja buduje pierwsze scentralizowane repozytoria danych. Procesy ETL zaczynają funkcjonować, a dane są pobierane do jednego miejsca. Pojawiają się pierwsze projekty machine learning, oparte na ustandaryzowanych zbiorach danych. Typowe technologie • Data Warehouse / Data Lake (np. BigQuery, Redshift, Snowflake) • ETL/ELT (Airflow, Fivetran, dbt) • Pierwsze API integracyjne 
Jak rozpoznać, że jesteś na tym poziomie • Dane w hurtowni są aktualizowane regularnie • Analitycy i data scientists mogą korzystać z uzgodnionych źródeł • Projekty AI nie wymagają manualnego łączenia danych  LEVEL 4 — Fully AI-Ready Data Architecture Jak to rozumieć Organizacja posiada spójne zasady governance, jakość danych jest monitorowana, a źródła danych są udokumentowane. Dane są dostępne w czasie zbliżonym do rzeczywistego. AI może trenować modele i aktualizować je w sposób powtarzalny i niezawodny. Typowe technologie • Real-time streaming (Kafka, Pub/Sub) • Data Catalog / Metadata Management • Automatyczne walidacje danych • Feature Store dla modeli AI Jak rozpoznać, że jesteś na tym poziomie • Dane są zawsze dostępne, spójne i aktualne • Modele AI mają stabilne, powtarzalne pipeline’y • Dane wykorzystywane są w wielu inicjatywach AI równocześnie  LEVEL 5 — Autonomous Data Intelligence Jak to rozumieć Dane są automatycznie przygotowywane, czyszczone, wersjonowane i udostępniane modelom AI. Systemy potrafią wykrywać anomalie, uzupełniać braki i optymalizować przepływy danych bez udziału człowieka. To najwyższy stopień dojrzałości fundamentów AI. 
Typowe technologie • Automatyczne data quality engines • Self-healing pipelines • Real-time feature engineering • Monitoring driftu danych i modeli Jak rozpoznać, że jesteś na tym poziomie • Systemy same reagują na problemy z danymi • AI działa na danych w czasie rzeczywistym, bez ręcznej ingerencji • Dane są traktowane jako produkt („data as a product”) ----------------------------------------------------- 
⭐ AREA 7B — AI-Augmented Processes ----------------------------------------------------- Wprowadzenie (dlaczego to ważne) Procesy stanowią rdzeń działalności każdej organizacji — to one generują wynik finansowy, obsługują klientów, produkują wartość oraz organizują codzienną pracę. Dlatego dojrzałość w wykorzystaniu AI w procesach jest jednym z kluczowych elementów transformacji. Ten obszar mierzy, w jakim stopniu sztuczna inteligencja wspiera, optymalizuje lub autonomicznie prowadzi działania operacyjne w firmie. Ocena obejmuje: • zakres automatyzacji, • rolę AI w podejmowaniu decyzji, • integrację AI z systemami operacyjnymi, • stopień, w jakim procesy są projektowane „AI-first”. Wysoka dojrzałość oznacza, że procesy działają szybciej, taniej, stabilniej, przewidywalniej, a decyzje są podejmowane w sposób powtarzalny i oparty na danych.  
⭐ LEVEL 1 — Isolated AI Experiments 
Jak to rozumieć AI pojawia się w organizacji jedynie w formie małych, niepowiązanych inicjatyw. Mogą to być testy narzędzi generatywnych, chatboty, OCR lub podstawowe automatyzacje biurowe — ale nie mają one wpływu na główne procesy biznesowe. Procesy działają tak jak dotychczas, a AI pojawia się jako ciekawostka lub inicjatywa pojedynczych pracowników. Typowe technologie • ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot – używane prywatnie, nie jako część procesów • Proste narzędzia OCR • Pojedyncze makra, skrypty automatyzujące • Narzędzia do generowania treści (np. marketing) Jak rozpoznać, że jesteś na tym poziomie • AI działa „obok” procesów, nie w ich środku • Nie ma wpływu na decyzje operacyjne • Brak połączenia z systemami (ERP/MES/CRM) • Użycie AI zależy od indywidualnej inicjatywy, nie od strategii  
⭐ LEVEL 2 — Assisted Work Automation Jak to rozumieć AI wspiera pracowników w wykonywaniu zadań, ale nie decyduje w procesach. Pojawiają się pierwsze automatyzacje: planowanie spotkań, generowanie treści, analiza dokumentów, klasyfikacja maili, automatyczne przepływy pracy (RPA). Rola AI to przyspieszanie pracy człowieka, nie jej przejmowanie. Proces działa tak jak wcześniej — ale szybciej. Typowe technologie • RPA (UiPath, Power Automate) • Generative AI w obsłudze biura (podsumowania, transkrypcje, drafty) • Automatyczne klasyfikatory dokumentów • Predictive alerts w systemach analitycznych • Wtyczki AI do Excel/Office Jak rozpoznać, że jesteś na tym poziomie 
• AI poprawia efektywność, ale nie ma wpływu na jakość procesu • Każda decyzja wciąż należy do człowieka • AI nie posiada dostępu do danych operacyjnych „na żywo” • Automatyzacje są jednostkowe, działające tylko w swoich wycinkach  
⭐ LEVEL 3 — Integrated AI Decision Support Jak to rozumieć AI zaczyna być częścią procesu, a nie dodatkiem. Modele AI dostarczają rekomendacje operacyjne, np.: • prognozy sprzedaży, • predykcja awarii maszyn, • rekomendacje zamówień, • optymalizacja tras, • planowanie produkcji, • ocena ryzyka finansowego. Pracownicy podejmują decyzje w oparciu o wskazania AI. Procesy są projektowane tak, by uwzględniały dane i algorytmy — ale odpowiedzialność pozostaje po stronie człowieka. Typowe technologie • Modele ML (regresja, klasyfikacja, forecasting) • Systemy rekomendacyjne • Predykcyjne moduły ERP/MES/WMS • Computer vision w kontroli jakości • IoT + AI do analizy danych maszynowych Jak rozpoznać, że jesteś na tym poziomie • Każdy kluczowy proces ma elementy predykcyjne lub analityczne • Pracownik polega na rekomendacjach AI w codziennej pracy • Modele są trenowane cyklicznie, a dane przepływają automatycznie • Systemy generują powtarzalne rekomendacje o wysokiej jakości  
⭐ LEVEL 4 — Semi-Autonomous Processes Jak to rozumieć AI wykonuje część działań procesowych samodzielnie. Człowiek pełni rolę nadzorcy lub zatwierdzającego. Przykłady: • automatyczne planowanie produkcji z możliwością akceptacji, • autonomiczne przydzielanie zleceń do pracowników lub maszyn, • dynamiczne sterowanie zapasami, • automatyczne generowanie zamówień, • autonomiczne wykrywanie i klasyfikacja usterek, • priorytetyzacja zadań w obsłudze klienta.

• monitoruje procesy, • reaguje na odchylenia, • symuluje scenariusze, • podejmuje działania, • uczy się na podstawie wyników, • stale optymalizuje sposób działania organizacji. Człowiek zajmuje się nadzorem, audytami, strategią i rozwiązywaniem wyjątkowych sytuacji. Przykład (fabryka): AI zarządza harmonogramem produkcji, przepływem materiałów, kolejnością zleceń, jakością, maintenance i logistyką — działając w cyklu zamkniętej pętli. Typowe technologie • Multi-agent AI (operational agents, planning agents) • Autonomous decision engines • Digital twin + real-time optimization • Large Action Models • On-line reinforcement learning • Autonomous workflow orchestration Jak rozpoznać, że jesteś na tym poziomie • Procesy wykonują się w całości bez udziału człowieka • AI dynamicznie przebudowuje proces na podstawie danych w czasie rzeczywistym • Organizacja działa w modelu „closed-loop operations” • Pracownicy nie wykonują pracy operacyjnej — tylko nadzorują system ----------------------------------------------------- 
⭐ AREA 7C — AI in Products & Services ----------------------------------------------------- Wprowadzenie (dlaczego to ważne) Artificial Intelligence is not only a tool for improving internal processes — it fundamentally reshapes the value delivered to customers. This area evaluates the extent to which AI is: • embedded in products, • enhances customer experience, 
• creates new digital services, • builds competitive advantage, • generates new revenue streams. As organizations mature, AI transitions from a minor feature to a core element of product architecture, eventually giving rise to fully AI-native offerings that could not exist without advanced algorithms. Ten obszar odpowiada na pytania: • Czy produkty korzystają z danych użytkowników? • Czy AI tworzy przewagę na rynku? • Czy firma jest w stanie skalować swoje produkty dzięki AI? • Czy pojawiają się nowe modele biznesowe oparte o inteligencję maszynową? Poniżej znajdują się poziomy dojrzałości.  
⭐ LEVEL 1 — No AI Components in Products Jak to rozumieć Produkty i usługi nie zawierają żadnych elementów AI.

Przykłady: • autonomiczne moduły zarządzania produkcją, • inteligentne roboty reagujące na środowisko, • autonomiczne logistyczne systemy routingowe, 
• aplikacje, które same zmieniają UI, workflow i logikę działania. Typowe technologie • Reinforcement learning • Multi-modal AI • Real-time feedback loops • Auto-personalization engines • On-device learning (edge re-training) Jak rozpoznać, że jesteś na tym poziomie • Produkt samodzielnie podejmuje wiele decyzji • Zachowanie produktu zmienia się na podstawie danych • Produkt tworzy unikalne doświadczenia dla każdego klienta • AI jest fundamentem architektury — nie da się go „odłączyć”  
⭐ LEVEL 5 — AI-Native Business Offerings Jak to rozumieć Firma oferuje produkty lub usługi, które nie mogłyby istnieć bez AI. AI tworzy nie tylko funkcje — tworzy cały model biznesowy. Na tym poziomie powstają: • autonomiczne systemy zarządzania (fabryka, magazyn, park maszyn), • w pełni autonomiczne analityczne lub operacyjne „agenty”, • platformy predykcyjne, które działają jak „inteligentni współpracownicy”, • cyfrowe bliźniaki działające w trybie closed-loop, • oprogramowanie, które reaguje na środowisko w czasie rzeczywistym i podejmuje działania. To poziom firm, które budują własne modele, własną AI-architekturę i własne systemy autonomiczne. Technologie, które dominują • Multi-agent systems • Proprietary LLM/SLM models • Digital Twins + Autonomous Control Loops • Synthetic data generation pipelines 
• RLHF + real-time optimization • AI-operated ecosystems Jak rozpoznać, że jesteś na tym poziomie • Produkt działa jak inteligentny system, nie aplikacja • AI podejmuje autonomicznie decyzje strategiczne i operacyjne • Klienci kupują rozwiązanie głównie dlatego, że jest AI-native • Firma posiada własne modele lub własną warstwę agentów • AI umożliwia całkowicie nowe modele biznesowe, niedostępne wcześniej ----------------------------------------------------- 
⭐ AREA 7D — AI Governance, Safety & Ethics ----------------------------------------------------- Wprowadzenie (dlaczego to ważne) Wraz ze wzrostem wykorzystania sztucznej inteligencji rośnie znaczenie odpowiedzialnego zarządzania nią. AI niesie ogromną wartość, ale również nowe ryzyka: • błędne decyzje podejmowane autonomicznie, • niejawne uprzedzenia w danych (bias), • naruszenia prywatności i poufności, • niekontrolowane generowanie treści, • niezgodność z regulacjami (np. EU AI Act), • brak nadzoru nad modelem po wdrożeniu. Brak odpowiedniego governance może prowadzić do strat finansowych, utraty reputacji, ryzyk prawnych lub całkowitego wstrzymania projektów AI. Ten obszar bada, czy organizacja potrafi: • kontrolować ryzyka AI, • zapewniać bezpieczeństwo danych i modeli, • dokumentować procesy AI, • monitorować działanie systemów, • budować zaufanie i przejrzystość, • wdrażać AI zgodnie z etyką i prawem.

Axis 1: Digital processes
We begin with assessing digital processes. For a  business, a process is 
defined as any set of interrelated  and sequential actions or operations planned 
and executed to achieve  a specific outcome. Processes are crucial to the 
organization because  they define how its core activities and operations are 
performed . The great majority of a company`s processes are encompassed  
within the nine areas we deal with here, namely, the  seven core areas of sales, 
marketing, process technology and R &D, purchasing, logistics, production, 
and quality, and the two support  domains of finance and HR. 
Processes need to be well -defined, documented and optimized, as they 
determine the quality and  efficiency of an organization. Process optimization 
can save time, resources  and costs critical to competitiveness and success. 
Therefore, process management  is a pivotal component of business strategy 
that enhances organizations` operations and adaptability.

Digital Pathfinder

Organizations  differ in their internal processes. Nevertheless, certain 
processes are fundamental to most companies, regardless of industry or 
size. The set of processes we will be discussing primarily derives from 
manufacturing companies that engage in the production of physical goods, but 
variations on these processes can be customized to each company`s specific 
activities. For non-manufacturing organizations, this list will be slightly 
different and tailored to their needs. However, the concept of evaluation and 
the use of this matrix remains the same.
The digital transformation of processes within an organization unfolds through 
a structured seven-level development matrix, each stage enhancing efficiency 
and responsiveness to both external customer needs and internal organizational 
requirements. As processes are more comprehensively digitalized, they not 
only become more cost-effective but also more precisely aligned with user 
demands. The seven levels of digital processes are as follows:
Basic Data Registration: At this initial  stage, systems are implemented to 
collect and store basic data  relevant to specific processes. Data entry may be 
manual, or  it can be automated through dedicated applications, with datasets 
integrated  and annotated for easy accessibility.
Workstation Control: Digital tools, both software and hardware, are 
installed at various workstations to enhance operational efficiency. This 
equipment enforces adherence to job descriptions and reduces process errors 
by streamlining tasks at each station.
Process Control: All workstations involved in a particular process are  linked 
through a unified management and control system, allowing for  detailed 
process planning, target setting and performance evaluation.
Automation: Automation tools are introduced based on data from individual 
workstations and the entire process. These tools automate tasks that are 
repetitive and critical for customer satisfaction or organizational stability, 
including physical movements and modifications of material properties.  
Industrial robots, collaborative robots (cobots) and automated guided 
vehicles (AGVs) are examples of such automation.
Piotr Wisniewski, PhD
453
Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES): MES solutions collect, 
analyse , and display information across large organizational areas, providing 
decision-making  support. These systems visualize process outcomes and 
report real-time  key performance indicators (KPIs).
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP): At this level, most processes occur 
independently of operator decisions and are embedded within an integrated 
information system. Organizational roles are defined, with most processes 
relying on a unified system.
AI Support Algorithms: Algorithms that improve workflow by utilizing 
internal or  external datasets are deployed, enhancing the precision and 
efficiency of  processes as they evolve with new data. These algorithms 
provide  ongoing developmental support to the processes, continually 
adapting and learning  from operational data.

Area 1G. Quality processes
Quality  processes ensure that products and services meet predefined 
standards and customer expectations. These processes involve rigorous 
testing, monitoring and evaluation at various stages of production to detect 
and correct defects, thereby guaranteeing the reliability and safety of the final 
output.
Level 1. Recording of basic data. Electronic compliance sheets  are used to 
record basic data related to product quality . These electronic sheets contain 
information about quality parameters, measurement results , tests and other 
quality-related data.
Level 2. Workstation control.  Q u a l i t y  c o n t r o l  s y s t e m s  e m b e d d e d  i n  
machines and equipment are  used in the production process. These systems 
allow for real -time monitoring of quality parameters such as dimensions, 
surface features , or other critical characteristics. Cameras, sensors and 
analysers are used  for automatic quality control.
Level 3. Process control.  A  central system responds to quality defects. 
It quickly identifies, responds  t o  a n d  e l i m i n a t e s  q u a l i t y  d e f e c t s  i n  t h e  
production process by  automatically detecting defects, generating alerts, 
informing relevant personnel and initiating  corrective actions for improved 
product quality.
Level 4. Automation.  Robots and advanced vision systems are employed for 
precise automatic  examination of product quality. These systems can analyse 
defects, dimensions  and surface characteristics and can eliminate human 
errors to ensure  consistent quality.
Level 5. MES. A Quality Management System  (QMS) controls and monitors 
product quality at various stages of  production. This includes document 
management, quality planning and control, and  tracking of tests and 
inspections, as well as reporting on  product quality and process stability.
Level 6. ERP. Integrated ERP solutions are applied that encompass quality 
management in the production process and that integrate this information 
with other areas of business operations. ERP systems integrate quality

management, documentation, process control, customer complaint handling 
and other quality-related functions.
Level 7. AI support. AI algorithms determine the scope of quality  control in 
the production process for efficient and precise management  of the quality 
control process. These algorithms use data analysis  and product quality 
histories to automatically determine which production batches require detailed 
quality control.

Area 1H. Financial management processes
So  far, we have focused on so-called ‘core processes’. In addition to these, 
every organization has at least two support processes. The first of these is 
financial management. Financial management processes are crucial for 
maintaining the financial health and stability of the business. These 
processes encompass budgeting, financial forecasting, managing cash flows, 
and ensuring compliance with financial regulations. They enable strategic 
financial decision-making to support company growth and profitability.
Level 1. Recording of basic data. Technologies such as  OCR and electronic 
document management are used to record basic  data such as invoices, contracts 
and other financial documents. OCR  technology automatically extracts 
data from invoices and electronic document management  to accelerate and 
streamline the recording of financial data.
Level  2. Workstation control. Financial control (FC) tools and systems  such 
as financial management systems monitor and control financial indicators  
and financial reporting. FC systems analyse and control budgets, costs , 
profitability and other financial indicators.
Level 3. Process control.  Decision acceptance systems coordinate and control 
financial decision-making processes . This improves information flow, risk 
assessment and the approval and  monitoring of financial decisions at various 
levels of the organizational  hierarchy.
Level 4. Automation.  Robotic Process Automation (RPA) automates  processes 
for automatic and efficient execution of repetitive tasks. RPA  technology is 
used for tasks such as automatic invoice processing , report generation and 
financial analysis.
Level 5. MES. Workflow Management Systems optimize financial processes 
and control and track the progress of tasks. They automate and enhance 
financial processes such as payment approval, order management and cost 
reconciliation.
Level 6. ERP. Integrated ERP solutions provide financial control within the 
organization , process integration and real-time access to financial data.

Area 1I. HR processes
Human  Resources processes in an organization focus on managing the 
employee lifecycle from recruitment to retirement. This includes talent 
acquisition, training and development, performance management, and 
employee engagement. Effective HR processes are essential for building a 
motivated and skilled workforce that aligns with the organization`s goals and 
culture.
Level 1. Recording of basic data. Electronic work cards are used  to register 
basic HR data such as work hours, employee  presence and other time-
management-related information.
Level 2. Workstation control.  Systems engage in payroll management, 
overseeing salary data , payroll lists, tax declarations and other aspects of 
human resource  management.
Level 3. Process control.  Systems are used that  register work time and 
attendance so that employees can automatically  record their work hours using 
various technologies such as proximity  cards, biometric readers or mobile 
applications.
Level 4. Automation.  HR processes are automated using e-kiosks and web 
applications  that allow employees to independently manage their data, request 
leave , access documents and perform HR-related tasks.
Level 5. MES. Comprehensive Human Resource Management (HRM) 
software records personal data and employee assessments, and it is used in 
planning training, monitoring salaries and benefits, and career management.
